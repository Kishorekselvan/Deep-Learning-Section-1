Do not hold the ball entirely flat on your palm, as this causes the ball to slide around too easily. Instead grip it with your fingertips and allow for a small air pocket between your palm and the ball.\n","Start with your fingertips pointing toward your body.\n","By the time you finish the twist of your wrist, your hand will have made a 180-degree twist and your fingertips will be pointing away from your body.\n","Put your other hand on the side of the ball.\n","There should be some space between the ball and the palm of your hand. You want your thumb to be directly in the middle between the top and the bottom of the ball because it will provide the majority of the force as you toss the ball.\n","Flick your hand and thumb to spin the ball.\n","Simultaneously flick your dominant hand 180-degrees, pinky leading, while flicking your thumb on your non-dominant hand forward to spin the ball. Be sure to complete the two motions at the same time in order to create an equal force on both sides of the ball. If you choose to only use one hand to complete the spin, disregard the non-dominant thumb.\n","Use your finger pads to guide the ball in the proper direction.\n","You can use the pads of your fingers to keep the ball level on your finger. You should also use them to guide the ball and make sure it doesn't tilt to one side or fall over.[4]\n","Practice the toss several times.\n","Keep the toss only a few inches in the air so that you can quickly place your finger under the ball. If you toss the ball too high it will be very difficult to catch with your finger. The faster the ball spins, the longer you will be able to hold it on your finger, but the harder it will be to balance.\n","Catch the ball on the tip of your dominant index finger.\n","Toss the ball quickly but gently onto your index finger. Once you've mastered the speed and height of the ball toss, you should be able to catch the ball on your finger without much difficulty. The closer you can keep your hand to the ball, the easier it will be.[5]Dont toss it too hard. You can injure your finger.Some people find it easier to spin the ball on their middle fingers, instead.[6]\n","Keep your finger directly in the center of the ball where the grooves meet.\n","This position will make it easiest to keep the ball in a steady position. If its not there, you can adjust the ball until it is. Dont be afraid to practice this a few times before you get it right.[7]\n","Move your other arm upward to meet the ball.\n","You don't want the ball to be floating on its own for very long, so move your other arm up and make contact with the bottom of the ball with the tips of your fingers. Make sure to leave some space between the ball and the palm of your hand.\n","Bring your arm back down to a comfortable position.\n","When your finger makes contact with the ball, bring your arm down slowly. Use a gradual downward motion until your arm is at a comfortable resting height. For most people, this will be around waist height.\n","Spin it on your fingernail or fingertip  for a faster, smoother spin.\n","The nail allows the ball to spin with less resistance. However, if that position is uncomfortable for you, you can spin the ball on your fingertip instead.[8]\n","Slap the ball lightly with your non-dominant hand.\n","Gradually learn to create a faster spin by slapping the side of the ball with your non-dominant hand in the same direction that the ball is spinning. At first, slapping the ball will probably cause it to fall off of your finger, but eventually you will be able to slap it without causing it to fall.[9]Do 3 or 4 slaps at a time, and make sure not to slap too hard.A light, but swift slap should be enough to keep the ball going without disrupting the spin.\n","Continue practicing until you can balance the ball perfectly.\n","It might take awhile for you to master the spin, but keep at it until you do! Once you can spin the ball for more than 30 seconds, youre a pro! Try to find a time every day to practice, even if it's while you're watching TV.\n","3 Ways to Treat Numbness in Hands - wikiHow\n","Hold your hands in a comfortable, neutral position.\n","Numbness and tingling can occur when you sleep on your hands or hold them in an awkward position. Changing positions usually does the trick. Relax your hands and arms, and keep your elbows and wrists straight.[3]\n","Shake your hands until the numbness subsides.\n","If numbness persists for longer than 30 seconds after changing positions, try shaking your hands at the wrists. Sometimes, median nerve compression (also known as carpal tunnel syndrome) caused by prolonged wrist extension can be alleviated by gently shaking the hand.[4] Avoid shaking your hands so hard that your wrists pop or crack.[5]If you sleep on your hand, your nerves and circulation are compressed for a long duration. Numbness might stick around longer than if you held your hand in an awkward position for a few minutes.\n","Run your hands under warm water for 2 to 3 minutes.\n","If your hands are still numb, hold them under running water thats about 90 to 100F (32 to 38C). Be sure the water is warm instead of hot. Slowly flex and stretch your hands and wrists as you hold them under the water.[6]Warm water can increase blood flow and soothe your hands. Its also recommended for numbness related to underlying conditions, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and Raynauds phenomenon.\n","See your doctor if you experience frequent or asymmetrical numbness.\n","Occasional, temporary numbness is normal. However, numbness that's frequent, persistent, or on just one side of your body could be a sign of an underlying condition, such as nerve strain or damage.[7]Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common nerve condition related to numbness in the hands and forearms. Less common causes include fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, and spinal disorders.See a doctor promptly for numbness related to an injury or if you experience dizziness, difficulty talking, weakness, headache, or confusion.\n","Tell your doctor which parts of your hands are affected.\n","Different forms of nerve strain or damage affect distinct parts of the hand. Your doctor can perform tests to accurately diagnose nerve compression or damage. Theyll examine your forearms and hands, have you move your hands and fingers, and, if necessary, perform an x-ray.[8]Numbness in the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers (and the side of your palm with these fingers) is a symptom of carpal tunnel syndrome.If your ring and little fingers become numb when you bend your elbow, cubital tunnel syndrome could be the issue.Numbness or pain concentrated at the top of the hand could be due to a compressed radial nerve.\n","Take frequent stretch breaks during repetitive activities, such as typing.\n","Taking periodic breaks and doing gentle hand exercises can help improve your symptoms.[9] Every 20 to 30 minutes, hold your hands in a prayer pose about 6 inches (15cm) in front of your chest. Keeping your hands in the prayer position, raise your elbows until you feel a stretch in your forearms. Hold the stretch for 10 to 20 seconds, then relax.You can also extend your right arm in front of you with your wrist bent so the back of your hand faces you. Use your left hand to gently pull your right fingers toward you so you feel a stretch in your right forearm. Hold the stretch for 10 to 20 seconds, then switch arms.[10]\n","Alternate soaking your hands in cold and warm water.\n","Fill one bucket with cold water and another with warm (not hot) water. Soak your hands and forearms in the cold water for 2 to 3 minutes, then soak them in the warm water. Continue alternating until you've held your hands in each bucket 3 times.[11]Try soaking your hands in cold and warm water 3 to 4 times daily (or whenever you feel numbness or tingling).\n","Wear wrist braces while you sleep for carpal tunnel syndrome.\n","For carpal tunnel syndrome, wear wrist braces to keep your hands and forearms in neutral positions while you sleep.[12]Ask your doctor to recommend the right brace for your particular issue.\n","Wear elbow braces for cubital tunnel syndrome while you sleep.\n","Bending the elbow aggravates cubital tunnel syndrome, so wearing elbow braces at night is best for this condition. Ask your doctor to recommend the best brace.[13]You can also wrap a towel around the appropriate joint, then use tape to secure it.\n","Ask your doctor if they recommend a cortisone shot.\n","If numbness, tingling, and pain interfere with your daily activities, a corticosteroid shot might provide relief. While a cortisone shot can relieve flare-ups, its effects are temporary.[14]You might experience pain and swelling at the injection site for the first 1 to 2 days after getting a cortisone shot. If necessary, apply ice for 15 minutes every 3 hours.Your doctor might also recommend an oral corticosteroid, such as prednisone. Let them know if you have diabetes, as corticosteroids can make it difficult to regulate insulin levels.[15]\n","See a physical therapist for numbness related to neck issues.\n","Since the nerves in the hands are rooted in the neck, spinal problems can cause numbness throughout the arms, hands, and fingers. If necessary, ask your doctor to refer you to a licensed physical therapist or chiropractor.[16]Serious neck issues, such as bone spurs or a herniated disc, might require surgery.\n","Quit smoking\n","and drinking alcohol, if necessary. Smoking and heavy drinking can constrict blood flow and aggravate nerve issues. If youre a smoker, ask your doctor or pharmacist for tips on quitting. If you drink more than the recommended amount, try to cut down your consumption.[17]The recommended intake for men is up to 2 drinks per day. For women, the recommended amount is 1 drink.[18]\n","Ask your doctor if you need to consume more vitamin B12.\n","Symptoms of a vitamin B deficiency include numbness in the hands, legs, or feet, balance problems, difficulty thinking, weakness, and yellowing of the skin. If you suspect you have a deficiency, talk to your doctor about making dietary changes or taking a vitamin supplement.[19]Sources of vitamin B12 include red meat, poultry, seafood, dairy products, and eggs. Plants dont make vitamin B12, so strict vegetarians and vegans are at a higher risk of developing a deficiency.Talk to your doctor before taking any vitamin or dietary supplement.\n","Manage your blood glucose levels if you have diabetes.\n","High glucose levels and low insulin levels related to diabetes can cause diabetic neuropathy, which is a type of nerve damage. If necessary, work with your doctor or specialist to get your glucose levels under control. Your doctor or pharmacist can also recommend oral or topical medication to help relieve numbness and pain.[20]\n","Get tested for Raynauds phenomenon.\n","People with Raynauds phenomenon have limited blood flow to the fingers and toes, which causes them to feel numb and cold. During attacks, fingers or toes might also turn white or blue. If your doctor suspects you have Raynauds phenomenon, theyll perform a physical exam, order a blood test, and look at your fingernails under a microscope.[21]If you have Raynauds phenomenon, do your best to keep your hands and feet warm. Regular exercise can help improve blood flow, but you should consult your doctor before starting a new workout routine.Your doctor might also prescribe medication to regulate your blood pressure or relax constricted blood vessels.[22]Tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine can bring on attacks, so avoid these substances.\n","Consult your doctor for numbness related to cancer treatment.\n","Numbness in the hands, feet, and other body parts is a common side effect of chemotherapy drugs. Tell your doctor or specialist about these or any other side effects. They might be able to prescribe medication to help relieve pain, numbness, or tingling.[23]\n","4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow\n","Measure the trees circumference at breast height.\n","Average breast height, which is a forestry measurement, is ft (1.4m) from ground level. Wrap a fabric measuring tape around the trunk at this height, and note the trees circumference.[1]If the ground is sloped, measure ft (1.4m) from ground level on the uphill side, mark the spot, then do the same on the downhill side. The average breast height is the midpoint between the uphill and downhill measurements.For a trunk that forks at a height less than ft (1.4m), measure the circumference just below the fork.\n","Find the trunks diameter and radius.\n","To find the diameter, divide the circumference by pi, or approximately 3.14. Then find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2.[2]For example, if the circumference is 154in (390cm), the diameter is approximately 49in (120cm), and the radius is about in (62cm).\n","Subtract 14 to 1in (0.64 to 2.54cm) to account for the bark.\n","For tree species with thick bark, such as black oak, subtract 1in (2.5cm) from the radius measurement. Subtract in (0.64cm) for species with thin bark, such as birch. If youre not sure and just want a rough estimate, subtract in (1.3cm) from the radius.[3]Including the bark would add extra girth and throw off your measurements.\n","Use nearby fallen trees to calculate an average ring width.\n","Check around the tree in question for dead or fallen trees of the same species. If you find one with visible rings, measure the radius and count the rings. Then divide the radius by the number of rings to find the average ring width.[4]Suppose theres a nearby stump with a radius of 25in (64cm), and you count 125 rings. The average ring width would be in (0.51cm).Growth rates vary by tree species and environmental conditions. The living tree youre measuring probably grew at a rate similar to a tree of the same species that grew nearby.Youll plug your ring width measurement or, if there are no nearby stumps, an average growth rate into an equation to estimate the trees age.Even if you have the average ring width, you can also use the average growth rate to estimate the age, then compare the results of the 2 methods.\n","Look up the species average growth rate, if necessary.\n","If you cant find any nearby stumps or felled trees, search online for the average growth rate for the species of the tree youre measuring. Including your location in your search terms could yield more accurate results. In general, a tree is probably around 8-15 years old for every 1ft (0.30m) of trunk diameter. For instance, if the circumference of a tree is 6ft (1.8m) around, it's probably at least 50 years old if it's a hardwood.[5]For example, oak, ash, beech, and sycamore trees grow about  to in (1.3 to 1.9cm) in circumference per year. If you dont know the species, plug both in (1.3cm) and in (1.9cm) into your equation to guess an age rage.For a more accurate estimate, factor in the trees location. In open conditions, growth rates are usually greater, or  to 1in (1.9 to 2.5cm) per year. Growth tends to be slower in urban locations and crowded forests.Be sure to check how the growth rate is calculated. Many sources base growth rates on how much the trees girth, or circumference, grows per year. However, you might find rates based on the average ring width of the radius.\n","Divide the radius by the average ring width.\n","If you used a nearby stump to calculate the average ring width, divide the radius of the living tree in question by the average ring width.[6]Say that, excluding the bark, your tree has a radius of about 24 in (60.96 cm). Using a nearby tree stump of the same species, you calculated an average ring width of 0.20 in (0.508 cm).Divide 24 (or 60.96) by 0.20 (or 0.508) to come up with an estimated age of 120 years.\n","Divide the circumference by the average annual growth rate.\n","If you found the average annual growth rate based on girth, or circumference, divide your trees circumference by the growth rate.Suppose your trees circumference is 154 in (391.16 cm), and its growth rate is between 0.75 and 1 in (1.905 and 2.54 cm) per year. Divide 154 (or 391.16) by 0.75 (or 1.905), then divide 154 (or 391.16) by 1 (or 2.54). Your estimated age range would be between 154 and 205 years old.\n","Count whorls to estimate the age of a conifer.\n","Whorls are rows of branches that grow from the trunk at approximately the same height. Counting whorls is an option for conifers, or evergreen trees, but isnt very useful for broadleaf trees, like oak or sycamore. This method isn't as accurate as counting the rings, but it's a way to estimate the tree's age without having to kill or injure it.[7]Conifers produce whorls annually at regular intervals. Deciduous, or broadleaf trees, produce them irregularly, making it difficult to get an accurate count.Its also easiest to count the whorls of a young conifer. You might not be able to see the top of a tall, mature conifer, and there would be more irregularities in its growth patterns.\n","Count the rows of branches growing at the same height.\n","At the base of the tree, look for a row of branches that grow at the same level, a bare length of trunk, then another row of branches. These rows are the whorls; count them until youve reached the top of the tree.[8]You might see single branches growing between whorls or 2 whorls spaced closely together. These are irregularities that might indicate an injury or unusual weather conditions that year, so dont count them.\n","Include any stubs or knots at the bottom of the trunk.\n","Check beneath the first row of branches for evidence of prior growth. Look for knots in the trunk and stubs where branches once grew, which youll count as additional whorls.[9]For instance, suppose your tree has 8 recognizable whorls. Beneath the first row, you can see a few stubs that emerge from the trunk around the same level. There's also a row of 2 or 3 knots under the stubs. Youd count the stubs and knots as additional whorls, so your total count would be 10.\n","Add 2 to 4 years to account for seedling growth.\n","The tree germinated and grew as a seedling for a few years before it started sprouting woody whorls. Add 2 to 4 to your whorl count to factor in this early growth.[10]If your whorl count was 10, your final age estimate would be between 12 and 14 years.\n","Examine the rings of an exposed stump.\n","The number of rings on a stump indicates the number of years the tree lived. Youll see rings of darker and lighter bands; 1 year of growth is composed of both a dark and light band. Since theyre easier to distinguish, count the dark bands to estimate the age.The rings can also tell you about the environmental conditions for a particular year. Thinner rings represent colder or dryer years, and thicker rings represent better growing conditions.\n","Sand the stump to see the rings more clearly.\n","If the rings are hard to make out, start by sanding them with coarse, 60-grit sandpaper. Finish with a very fine sandpaper, such as 400-grit. Spraying the surface lightly with water can also make the rings easier to see.You might find that some rings are too close together to see clearly. If necessary, use a magnifying glass to get a better view.\n","Count the rings from the pith to the bark.\n","Find the pith, or the small circle at the center of the concentric rings. Start counting from the first dark band around the pith. Continue counting until youve reached the bark. The last ring is pressed up against the bark and hard to see, so make sure to include it in your count.[11]If you have trouble keeping track, try writing a number or making a mark every 10 rings with a pencil.\n","Take a core sample of a living tree using an increment borer.\n","To accurately estimate the age of a living tree without killing it, use a borer to take a core sample. An increment borer is a T-shaped instrument composed of an augur, or a bit, and an extractor, which fits into the augur. The end of the T-shape is a handle, which you turn to drill in and out of the tree. The length of your increment borer should be at least 75% of the tree's diameter. You can find increment borers online and at forestry supply stores.\n","Drill into the trunk at breast height.\n","Measure ft (1.4m) up the trunk from ground level. Position the borers bit at that height on the middle of the trunk.[12]Taking a sample at breast height gives you an estimate called the DBH age. You'll need to add 5 to 10 years to the DBH age to estimate the trees total age.You'll take the sample at breast height because its not practical to take one at the trees base. Roots, brush, and the ground would prevent you from turning the handle, and its hard to drill while crouching or lying on the ground.\n","Bore just past the trunks estimated center point.\n","Apply firm pressure and turn the handle clockwise to drill into the tree trunk. Continue turning until you think youve drilled around 2 to 3in (5.1 to 7.6cm) passed the pith, or the center of the trunk.[13]Calculate the trees radius to estimate how far youll need to drill. Measure the trees circumference, divide by pi (about 3.14) to find the diameter, then divide the diameter by 2 to find the radius.\n","Insert the extractor, then turn the handle counterclockwise.\n","The extractor is a long tube with teeth at an end. It fits into the augur, or the part that youve drilled into the tree. Slide in the extractor, then turn the handles clockwise to remove the instrument and extract a core sample.[14]\n","Remove the sample and locate the pith, or the center of the trunk.\n","After sliding the core sample out of the extractor, youll see an array of curved concentric lines. These are sections of the trees rings. You should see a dot at the interior end (opposite the bark end) of the core sample that marks the center point of the concentric rings. If you dont see the pith, place the sample on a large sheet of paper, and extend the curved lines to make full rings on the paper. Based on the rings youve drawn, try to guess where the center point would be, and estimate how many rings youre missing.[15]\n","Count the rings on the core sample.\n","After youve found the pith at the samples interior end, count the dark curved lines until youve reached the bark end of the sample. Use a magnifying glass if you have trouble seeing tightly clustered rings. If you have trouble making out the curved lines, sand the sample to make them more visible. Start with 60-grit sandpaper, then finish with a fine grit, such as 400.Remember that your ring count gives you the trees DBH age estimate. Add 5 to 10 years to estimate the trees total age.[16]\n","How to Make a School Survival Kit: 12 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Include some extra school supplies.\n","If you run out of something in your backpack or pencil bag, it's good to have some extras of the most important stuff in your survival kit.

Only pick stuff that you're likely to need to use, and take out stuff that you end up never using. If you've never used a highlighter in your whole life, don't put one in your kit. Only you know yourself and what's best for you.Revisit your survival kit after a few weeks of school. If there's a stapler always available in the office for students to use, you probably don't need to have your own in your survival kit.\n","Decorate and label your kit.\n","Depending on what kind of kit you've got, it can be fun to decorate it. If you're a creative type, decorate your kit with stickers and markers to personalize it.Check out Pinterest for a lot of creative ideas about how to organize and decorate your kit.Alternatively, it might be fun to make your survival kit look like something else.

It might seem like theyre always ready to jump at a better opportunity instead of spending time with you, and they likely give you barely any heads up before ditching your plans.For example, a friend who doesnt value you might cancel your plans to go hang out with someone else.Or, they might just give vague excuses like, I cant today, even though youve had those plans set for a while.If this happens repeatedly, have a direct conversation with them. Say something like, I noticed youve been really busy lately, Is there something going on? as a way to better understand their situation.\n","Theyre not someone you can rely on.\n","A friend who doesnt value you likely doesnt feel too guilty breaking promises and might have even made a habit out of it. At some point, it might feel like you cant depend on them when it comes to important matters. For example, they might have a history of not showing up to help you when they said they would, such as when you were moving or starting a new project.[1]They might have also broken promises around some of the boundaries you set. For example, even if they promised at first not to talk about a topic thats sensitive to you, they mightve still brought it up at some point.To deal with this kind of situation, ask them first what mightve caused them to break their promise to get their side of the story.If they continue this behavior, establish some sort of consequence to show them that their actions are really hurting you. For example, you might decide to take a break from them for a while after they broke a promise.\n","Youre likely the one always reaching out to them.\n","If it feels like youre the only one putting effort into your relationship, its likely that your friend doesnt truly value your friendship. It might be that they also dont text you or reach out that often, and you might only see and hear from them once in a while despite being their friend.[2]If you notice some of these patterns, take a moment to evaluate your friendship and ask yourself if your needs are being met.For example, you might desire a friendship with someone whom you can talk to often. If this friendship isnt giving you that, it might be a sign that the connection between you and your friend isnt the best or healthiest for you.\n","They make insensitive comments and belittle you in front of others.\n","A friend who doesnt value you might act condescending toward you through the things they say, such as by saying Youre so dumb or Youre so bad at that. They also might use sarcasm with you a lot. Because of this, you might feel less confident around them or like you cant be your true self with them.[3]To deal with a condescending friend, call them out on their behavior and have a discussion with them.Say something like, You seem really critical of me lately or Ive felt really hurt by some of the things youve said to me recently.\n","They may interrupt you or even talk over you.\n","A friend who doesnt value you might not let you get a word in edgewise when talking to you. Instead, they might only talk about themselves and whats going on in their life, and they rarely ask for your opinion. It might feel like they dont value what you have to say or have any interest in whats going on with your life.To deal with someone who talks too much, listen to them for a bit, but then politely interrupt them to make them aware that you have something to say.For example, say something like, Are you finished? Id like to say something.If they try to interrupt you, assert yourself by saying, I listened to you, so please give me a chance to say what I want to say.\n","They always try to one-up your achievements.\n","A true friend would be happy when you achieve something great and be there to celebrate with you. However, a friend who doesnt truly value you might easily get jealous when you share good news with them. Instead of celebrating, they might try to make themselves the center of attention by bringing up their own achievements.[4]Even though it might feel like theyre trying to make everything a competition, avoid giving in to the urge to compete with them.Instead, focus on your achievements and encourage yourself by telling yourself things like, I did well and Im proud of myself.Reader Poll: We asked 814 wikiHow readers whats the strongest indicator someone doesnt want to be your friend, and only 9% of them agreed that they arent happy when you achieve something. [Take Poll] It can definitely hurt when it feels like your friends dont care about your achievements, but its possible they dont realize what theyre doing. Its best to talk to them about the situation before assuming the worst.\n","They dont make an effort to make you feel confident in yourself.\n","A true friend is someone who hypes you up and is always there to encourage you. However, a friend who doesnt value you may be slow to give you praise or show support for the things you do. Or, they might just give very lukewarm compliments, such as That outfit doesnt look too bad or You did alright, I guess.[5]Use positive affirmations to build up your confidence if your friend isnt there to help you. Tell yourself things like, I like how I look or Im doing really well.Be honest with your friend and tell them how you feel when they make such comments. Say something like, I feel like youre not really excited for me and your words feel more like backhanded compliments to me.\n","They want you to prioritize them, but they may not prioritize you.\n","If they expect you to be at their beck and call 24/7, it shows that they dont really value you as a person with their own life and responsibilities. They might expect you to drop your plans whenever they want to go out, but they wont make themselves available when you want to hang out. If they constantly expect you to be there for them, your friendship might feel more exhausting than fulfilling.[6]If youre feeling exhausted by their constant requests for you to be there for them, set boundaries about how you want to spend your time.For example, tell them firmly that you need alone time to recharge. If they cant respect that, tell them that you might need to take a break from them for a bit.\n","They take advantage of your generosity but may not reciprocate it.\n","A friend who doesnt value you may not contact you often, but when they do, its usually only because they need you to do a favor for them. They might say something like, I know its been a while, but I need your help with something. They might simply expect you to drop everything to help them but likely wont return the favor or really show you any gratitude for your help.Set clear boundaries and say no when their requests infringe on your own life or create inconveniences for you. Say something like, I cant help you this time or make them promise to return the favor by saying, Ill help you so long as you help me with something else.\n","You always end up doing what they want to do.\n","Whenever it comes time to decide on an activity, they may always be very insistent that you do the thing they want to do. A friend who doesnt value you can end up dominating your plans and likely doesnt ask for your input.The way to deal with a friend like this is to be assertive. State your opinion even if they dont directly ask you so that theyre forced to take your input into account.\n","They might judge your aspirations or belittle your goals.\n","Whereas a true friend will be there to encourage you to pursue your passions, a friend who doesnt value you might make condescending comments about your future plans or dreams. Instead of lifting you up, they might criticize your choices or make you doubt yourself.[7]For example, they might say something like, I dont think youll be any good at that. Why dont you try something more your speed?Remind yourself that just because your friend doesnt support your dreams doesnt mean that your goals are any less valuable or important.If your friends criticism is having a negative impact on your confidence, take a break from them for a while or consider ending the friendship. You want to be surrounded by positive people who will make you feel good about yourself.\n","They dont invite you to events or ignore you for other people.\n","This is a huge red flag of a friend who doesnt respect or value you. It might be that they dont want you to hang out with their other friends, so they purposefully exclude you from plans. A true friend is someone who works to make you feel included and like youre an important part of their life.[8]If your friend is ignoring you, deal with them by directly addressing the issue. Say, I feel like youve been avoiding me these past few weeks. Did something happen?\n","They might seem fake when they hang out with other friends.\n","When you and your friend are hanging out with a larger group, it might seem like they take on a whole new personality around their other friends. This might be a sign that they dont feel as at ease around you when others are around. They might prioritize maintaining a certain reputation over being genuine with you, which can signal that they dont truly value your friendship.[9]Talk to them about any changes you notice. Say something like, I notice you act a bit differently around our friends. Is there something I might be doing to make you feel uncomfortable?Make an effort to understand where they may be coming from. Its possible that these changes in their behavior are completely unconscious on their part.\n","You feel like they cant be trusted with your personal secrets.\n","When your friend goes behind your back and talks about you or spills the secrets that you entrusted them with, its a clear sign that they dont respect your privacy. It can feel like theyve seriously betrayed your trust.

Say something like, I felt really angry and betrayed after finding out that you told them my secret.Decide whether you can forgive them or if you think you need to step away from the friendship if theyve severely hurt you.\n","They make excuses or try to blame other people.\n","A friend who doesnt value you is someone who doesnt respect you by owning up to their actions. Instead, theyll try to come up with excuses or put the blame on their situation or other people. For example, if they broke a promise, they might say something like, I only acted like that because my job has been so stressful recently.[11]They might also just lie about what happened or deny that they did anything wrong. Rather than taking responsibility, they might say something like, I didnt do that or That was totally someone elses fault, not mine.Someone who takes responsibility for their actions would say something like, I messed up and theres no excuse for my actions. Im sorry I hurt you.Use I language to express to them how their actions made you feel without making it sound like youre accusing them. For example, instead of saying, It was really terrible of you to forget your promise, say, I felt let down when you didnt show up.\n","Their apologies are insincere or they dont apologize at all.\n","If they dont apologize when they make a mistake, its a sign that they dont value your friendship or respect you. Instead of apologizing, they might just promise to buy you food or make a vague promise not to do whatever it is they did again. This can undoubtedly be frustrating, especially if you know that they were in the wrong.[12]While it may be hard, sometimes its best to forgive them in order to move on with your relationship. This doesn't mean forgetting what they did. Instead, its about letting go of your anger and not allowing it to hold you back.If they consistently fail to apologize for their mistakes, it might be best to put some distance between you and them for a while and give them the opportunity to self-reflect on their actions.\n","They pressure you to break the rules even if youre uncomfortable.\n","Its a red flag if your friend pressures you to do things youre uncomfortable with or partake in risky activities. It shows that they dont truly respect you or your boundaries. For example, they might try to convince you to drink or do drugs even though youve said no.[13]Be firm in maintaining your boundaries if your friend tries to get you to do something youre uncomfortable with. Say no and establish some consequences if they dont listen to you.For example, tell them that you wont hang out with them for a few weeks if they continue their behavior.\n","They dont ask about your opinions or thoughts on things.\n","A true friend is someone who takes the time to get to really know you, but a friend who doesnt value your friendship may not bother to get to know about your life and interests. They might instead choose to just talk about themselves, or they may just gossip about other people instead of asking about you.Unfortunately, if it seems like theyre actively avoiding getting to know you, it might be that they dont want to be friends with you.In this situation, you might try opening up to them, but if they arent receptive of your attempts, it might be in your best interest to let them go and find a friend who shows a genuine interest in you.\n","They might forget your birthday or what job you do.\n","When your friend doesnt make an effort to remember the most basic details about you, its a sign that they dont truly value your friendship. Of course, people are bound to be forgetful at times, but if your friend cant remember important details about your life, like your birthday or things you enjoy doing, its a sign that they may not value you as much as they should.[14]\n","They dont appreciate what makes you unique.\n","A true friend is someone who accepts you for who you are. On the other hand, a friend who tries to change your personality or physical appearance doesnt truly value your individuality. They might constantly compare you to other people and make suggestions about how you can change yourself to be more appealing.[15]Stay true to yourself and take pride in who you are. Its your life and you dont need to change just so that other people are happy.If your friend cant accept that, it might be time to let them go. Focus on surrounding yourself with people who accept you unconditionally and encourage you to be your authentic self.\n","They may intentionally try to keep conversations surface-level.\n","An important part of friendship is sharing details about your life to the other person. However, a person who doesnt truly value your friendship may not open up despite your own attempts to form a deeper connection with them. They might deflect when you ask them questions or simply talk about trivial topics or other people.[16]Allow yourself to open up to encourage your friend to share more about themselves. Talk about things like your dreams, worries, or opinions on certain matters to start the conversation.Show them that youre actively listening when they talk to encourage them to share more. Get rid of distractions, dont interrupt them, and ask them questions to show them that youre engaged.\n","They might say theyre busy when you say you need them.\n","Despite the fact that you might always be there to support them when theyre having trouble, they might not be there to reciprocate the favor. If it seems like theyre always too busy to help or comfort you, it might mean that they dont value your friendship and are taking your generosity for granted.[17]For example, they might just send a Sorry that happened text rather than taking the time to listen to you and try to offer you more heartfelt support and comfort.Communicate your needs directly to your friend to help them see where they may be lacking in giving you support. For example, tell them, Id appreciate it if I was able to call you when I want to talk about something.Focus on finding ways to take care of yourself instead of solely relying on your friend for comfort. Do relaxing activities to comfort yourself and reach out to other friends and family who you know will be there to help you.\n","They might tell you to just get over it during hard times.\n","Even when youre dealing with something difficult, a friend who doesnt value you might not try to understand where youre coming from. Instead, they might simply brush your problems off or give you advice that doesnt really address whatever it is youre going through.They might also be a bit harsh in their delivery and tell you things like, Its not that bad. I dont know why youre getting so upset.The most important thing is that you receive the support you need, and this might mean that you need to put some distance between yourself and your friend for a while. During this time, reach out to other friends and family who can give you comfort.\n","They make you feel guilty for hanging out with other people.\n","If a friend gets jealous of the other relationships in your life or makes you feel like youre abandoning them for other people, it might be a sign that they dont truly value your friendship for what it is. Even if you make an effort to spend time with them, they might always feel like its not enough.[18]A true friend doesnt try to guilt you into spending time with them and respects your other relationships.Confront them about their feelings and make an effort to understand where their feelings may be coming from. Ask them, Is there something I did to make you feel this way?\n","They use guilt or even blackmail to get you to do what they want.\n","Friends who dont value you or respect your boundaries may have no problem with using manipulation to get you to do things the way they want. For example, they might gaslight you to make you feel guilty and take the blame for something.[19]Gaslighting is when someone makes you doubt yourself and your memories in order to manipulate you psychologically.For example, a friend who gaslights you might say something like, Youre not remembering that. You know Id never tell anyone your secrets, so why are you accusing me of that?Or, they might use guilt to get you to spend more time with them, such as by saying, Am I even your friend? You never make time for me.Gaslighting is a sign of a toxic friendship. If you notice this happening, put some distance between you and them or stop contacting them altogether to end the friendship.\n","Easy Ways to Treat Geographic Tongue: 9 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Try a salt water rinse to help ease your pain.\n","Salt water can help numb oral pain and make your mouth less sensitive.[2] Dissolve 1 teaspoon (6 g) of sea salt into  cup (120ml) of warm water.

Spit the rinse out when youre finished using it.[3]\n","Apply a topical analgesic to numb your tongue.\n","If you still feel discomfort after taking pain relievers, or you prefer to numb your tongue directly, then a topical analgesic gel will also help you manage your symptoms. Squeeze a bit of gel onto a Q-tip and rub it onto the irritated parts of your mouth. Repeat the treatment as often as the product instructions say you can.[4]Do not apply gels to your mouth with your finger. This can spread germs and infect the area.Check in the oral health section of your pharmacy for analgesic gel.

If your tongue is itchy, try rinsing with a mouthwash infused with antihistamines. These soothe the area and help reduce the itching. Repeat the rinse as often as the product label instructs you to.Many of the major mouthwash manufacturers also produce antihistamine products. See if the brand you normally use has one of these.Do not swallow mouthwash. Always spit it out when youre done.\n","Take anti-inflammatory pain relievers to alleviate your discomfort.\n","Geographic tongue is harmless, but can still cause pain and discomfort. You can manage these symptoms with over-the-counter pain relievers. Use anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen or ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation on your tongue. You can continue taking this medication daily while your symptoms last.[5]Follow all the dosage instructions on any product you use.

If youve had a vitamin B deficiency in the past, try boosting your intake through your diet or taking vitamin supplements.[6]Foods that are high in vitamin B include fruits, peas, eggs, whole grains, milk, and fish.[7]Check with your doctor before taking vitamin B supplements to make sure they wont interact with any drugs youre taking.Remember this will only work if you already have a vitamin B deficiency.

However, some cases are more severe and dont clear up. In this case, make an appointment with your dentist and have your tongue examined.

Reassure your loved one that the depression theyre feeling is real.[2]\n","Be firm.\n","Make it clear that you are worried about your friend.

Though it's important to be firm, don't come off too strong in the beginning.Dont start by saying, \"You're depressed. How are we going to deal with it?\" Instead, start off with: \"I've noticed that you've been pretty down lately. What do you think has been going on?\"Be patient.

You can still help your friend, but they should also see a mental health professional. There are different types of therapists, each of whom offers different skills or specialties. These include counselors, counseling psychologists, clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. You can see one or a combination of different ones.Counseling psychologists or counselors: Counseling psychology is a field of therapy that focuses on helping skills and helping people overcome difficult times in their lives. This type of therapy can be short or long-term and is often problem-specific and goal-directed. Look for licensed professional counselors (LPCs) or national certified counselors recognized by the National Board of Certified Counselors (NBCC).Clinical psychologists: These are trained to administer tests to confirm a diagnosis and therefore, tend to focus more psychopathology, or the study of behavioral or mental disorders.[4]Psychiatrists: These may use psychotherapy and scales or tests in their practice, but are typically seen when medication is an option the patient wants to explore. In most states, only psychiatrists can prescribe medication.\n","Give your loved one some referrals.\n","For help finding a counselor, consider recommendations from friends or family, religious community leaders, a local community mental health center, or a medical doctor.[5]Other professional associations like the American Psychological Association may provide search functions for locating their members in your area.[6]\n","Offer to make an appointment for your loved one.\n","If your loved one is unsure about seeing a medical professional, you might consider setting up the appointment for them.

Your loved one may benefit from different types of therapy depending on their situation.[7]Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): The goal of CBT is to challenge and change beliefs, attitudes, and preconceptions that are thought to underlie depressive symptoms and effect change to maladaptive behaviors.Interpersonal therapy (IPT): IPT focuses on dealing with life changes, building social skills, and addressing other interpersonal issues that may contribute to depressive symptoms. IPT may be particularly effective if a specific event (such as a death) has triggered a recent depressive episode.Psychodynamic therapy: This type of therapy aims to help a person understand and cope with feeling that derive from unresolved conflicts. Psychodynamic therapy focuses on identifying unconscious feelings.[8]\n","Suggest the possibility of medication.\n","Antidepressants can help a depressed person feel better while they undergo counseling.

[10]If an antidepressant alone isnt working, your therapist might recommend an antipsychotic. There are 3 antipsychotics (aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone) and an antidepressant/antipsychotic combination therapy (fluoxetine/olanzapine) approved to be used along with a standard antidepressant for treating depression when an antidepressant alone is not working.[11]A psychiatrist may suggest trying a few different medications until one seems to work. Some antidepressants backfire on some people. Its important that you and your loved one monitor how the medication affects them. Take special note of any negative or unwelcome change in mood immediately. Usually, switching to a different class of drug will fix the problem.\n","Pair medication with psychotherapy.\n","To maximize how medication works, your loved one should continue to visit a mental health professional on a regular basis while taking the medication.[12]\n","Encourage patience.\n","Both you and your loved one should be patient. The effects of counseling and medication are gradual. Your loved one will be attending regular sessions for at least a few months before noticing an effect. Neither of you should give up hope before the counseling and medication has had time to work.Generally speaking, it will take at least three months to see any lasting effect from an antidepressant.\n","Determine if you should get permission to discuss treatment.\n","Depending on your relationship with this person, you might see if you can get permission to discuss treatments with their doctors. Normally, someones medical records and information are confidential. There are special considerations regarding records privacy when mental health is concerned. Your loved one would most likely need to give written permission for you to discuss treatments.If your loved one is a minor (under the age of consent), the parent or guardian will have permission to discuss treatment.\n","Make a list of medications and treatments.\n","Compile a list of medications that your loved one takes, including dosages. List the treatments they are receiving as well. This will help in making sure that your loved one is following their treatments and keeping up with their medications.\n","Communicate with others in the person's support network.\n","You should not be the only person who is trying to help your loved one. Get in touch with trusted family, friends, or clergy. If the depressed person is an adult, be sure to ask them for permission first to speak with others and rally support. By talking to others, you will pick up additional information and perspectives about your loved one. This will help you feel less alone with the situation.Be careful when you tell other people about the person's depression. People can be judgmental if they do not understand the issue fully. Carefully choose whom you tell.\n","Be a good listener.\n","The best thing you can do is listen to your loved one talk about the depression. Be prepared to hear anything that they may say. Try not to look too shocked even if they are saying something truly awful, because that will shut them down. Be open and caring. Listen without judgement.If your loved one will not talk, try asking a few gently phrased questions. This might help them open up. Try asking how they spent their week, for example.When your loved one tells you something upsetting, encourage them by saying, \"It must have been very difficult for you to tell me that,\" or \"Thank you so much for opening up.\"\n","Give your loved one your full attention.\n","Put away your phone, make eye contact, and show that you are giving 100 percent of your effort to your conversation.\n","Know what to say.\n","What a person suffering from depression needs most is compassion and understanding. Not only do you have to listen well, but you need to be sensitive about what you say when you talk about the depression. These are some helpful phrases to use when talking with your loved one: You are not alone in this. I'm here for you.I understand you have a real illness and that's what causes these thoughts and feelings.You may not believe it now, but the way you're feeling will change.I may not be able to understand exactly how you feel, but I care about you and want to help.You are important to me. Your life is important to me.\n","Dont tell them to snap out of it.\n","Telling someone to \"snap out of it\" or \"lighten up\" isn't usually a helpful thing to say. Be sensitive. Imagine feeling like the world is against you and everything is falling apart. What would you want to hear? Realize that depression is a very real and painful state for the sufferer. Dont use phrases like these: It's all in your head.We all go through times like this.You'll be fine. Stop worrying.Look on the bright side.You have so much to live for; why do you want to die?Stop acting crazy.What's wrong with you?Shouldn't you be better by now?\n","Dont argue about how your loved one is feeling.\n","Dont try to talk the depressed person out of their feelings. The depressed persons feelings may be irrational, but saying that they're wrong or arguing with them is not the way to go. Instead, you might try saying, \"Im sorry that youre feeling bad. What can I do to help?\"Be aware that your loved one may not be honest about how bad they are feeling. Many depressed people are ashamed of their condition and lie about their depression. If you ask, \"Are you okay?,\" and they say yes, think about asking in a different way to get at how they really feel.\n","Help your loved one see the positive side of things.\n","When talking with your loved one, try to hold as much positive conversation as possible. Don't be forcefully perky, but show your friend a better angle of their life and situation.\n","Stay in contact.\n","Call your loved one, write them an encouraging card or letter, or visit them at home. This will show that you will stick by them no matter what. There are many different ways to stay in contact with the person you care about.Make a point of seeing your loved one as often as you can without overwhelming them.If you're working, email them to check in.If you can't call every day, communicate through texting as often as you can.\n","Take your loved one for a walk.\n","Your loved one may feel better, even just a little bit, if they spend some time out of the house. It can be monumentally difficult for a person suffering from depression to get outside in the first place. Offer to do something that your loved one might enjoy in the fresh air.You don't have to train for a marathon together. Just try going for 20-minute walk with your loved one. They may feel a little better after engaging in some physical activity outdoors.\n","Get out into nature.\n","Some studies have shown that connecting with nature can reduce stress and elevate mood. [13] According to research, walking in green areas can help a persons mind get in a meditative state, contributing to further relaxation and improved mood.[14]\n","Enjoy the sun together.\n","Getting some sunshine will elevate a persons vitamin D levels, which can contribute to improved mood.[15] Even just sitting on a bench and soaking in some sunlight for a few minutes can be helpful.\n","Encourage your friend to pursue new interests.\n","Your friend may get distracted, even momentarily, from their depression if they have something to engage in and look forward to. While you shouldn't force your friend to take up skydiving or learn the entirety of the Japanese language, encouraging your loved one to have some interests can help shift the focus away from their depression.Find some uplifting literature for your friend to read. You can read together in a park, or discuss the book.Bring over a movie by your favorite director. Your friend can fall in love with a new range of movies, and you can keep your friend company while you watch.Suggest that your friend try to express their artistic side. Drawing, painting, or writing poetry can help your friend express themself. This is also something that you can do together.\n","Acknowledge your friends achievements.\n","Whenever your friend achieves a goal, acknowledge and congratulate them. Even small goals, such as taking a shower or going to the grocery store, can be significant for someone who is depressed.\n","Be there to improve your loved one's everyday life.\n","You can encourage your loved one to try new things and get outside, but sometimes the best thing you can do is be there for all the mundane things. This can help your loved one feel less alone.Being there for low-key activities like making lunch or watching TV can make a big difference.You can ease the depressed persons burden by helping with the small things. This might be running errands, shopping for food and necessities, cooking, cleaning, or doing your loved one's laundry.Depending on the situation, giving your loved one healthy physical contact (such as a hug) can help them feel better.\n","Step back every so often.\n","You may become frustrated when your well-meaning advice and reassurance are met with sullenness and resistance. It is important that you dont take your loved ones pessimism personally. Its a symptom of the illness, not a reflection of you. If you feel that this pessimism is taking up too much of your energies, take a break and spend time doing something that you find inspiring and enjoyable.This is especially important if you live with the person and find it hard to get away otherwise.Direct your frustration at the illness, not the person.Even if you don't hang out, make sure to check in at least once a day so you know your loved one is coping.The bigger their support network is, the easier it is for individual members to take time away.\n","Take good care of yourself.\n","It is easy to get wrapped up in your friends problems and lose sight of yourself. Being around a person who is depressed could bring your mood down, or you may get your own issues triggered. Recognize that your feelings of frustration, helplessness, and anger are perfectly normal.If you have too many personal issues of your own to sort out, you may not be fully able to help your friend. Don't use your friend's problems as a means to avoid your own.Recognize when your efforts to help the other person are keeping you from enjoying your life or taking care of the things that matter the most to you. If your depressed loved one has become too dependent on you, that is not healthy for either of you.If you feel that you're getting seriously affected by your friend's depression, seek help. It may be a good idea for you to see a counselor yourself.\n","Make time for life away from your depressed loved one.\n","Although you're being an incredible friend by providing emotional and physical support, remember to schedule some \"me time\" so you can enjoy a healthy and relaxing life.Hang out with plenty of friends and family members who are not depressed, and enjoy their company.\n","Be healthy.\n","Get outdoors, train for a 5K, or walk to the Farmer's Market. Do what you have to do to retain your inner-strength.\n","Make time to laugh.\n","If you can't make your depressed loved one laugh a little bit, take the time to hang out with funny people, watch a comedy, or read something hilarious online.\n","Don't feel guilty about enjoying your life.\n","Your friend is depressed, but you are not, and you are allowed to enjoy your existence. Remind yourself that if you're not feeling like your best self, you won't be able to help your friend.\n","Educate yourself about depression.\n","If you know someone with depression, you must have an understanding of what they're going through. Most people don't understand what it's like to have a disorder like depression. This general ignorance makes life far more difficult for depressed people. Having just one person who doesn't judge or criticize, who knows to give them some slack, could literally be a lifesaver for any of them. Read up on depression and talk to a mental health expert, or maybe a person who has had depression or a similar disorder.\n","How to Start Hormone Replacement Therapy (Male to Female)\n","Find an endocrinologist or another local healthcare provider.\n","Ask your primary care doctor if they can offer you HRT. Some physicians can provide HRT. In most cases, however, they will refer you to an endocrinologist, which is a doctor who specializes in hormones. If you do not have a primary care doctor, you can find your closest endocrinologist by going here: https://www.aace.com/.Contact your local LGBT support organization to see if they have any recommendations for a good doctor.Some Planned Parenthood locations in the US offer HRT.\n","Provide informed consent about the transition process.\n","Your doctor will talk to you about the changes, side effects, and processes of undergoing HRT. They may also provide pamphlets and other reading material. Go through these carefully. Once you are certain that you want to continue, sign a document giving informed consent to the doctor to proceed.Most doctors will only provide HRT to people 18 or over. Older adolescents may be able to undergo therapy with their parent or guardians permission. Talk to your doctor for more information.HRT will increase your risk of blood clots, cancer, and stroke.After a few months on HRT, you will become irreversibly sterile. If you would like to preserve sperm to have a child some day, talk to your doctor about your options.\n","Demonstrate that you are capable and willing to undergo HRT.\n","Some doctors may require proof that you are comfortable living as a female and that you are able to make the decision to undergo HRT. To do this, you may need to show that you have lived for 12 months as a woman. If you are working with a therapist, you can also have them provide a reference for you.[1]Some doctors may require that you undergo a psychological evaluation by a therapist. They can refer you to a therapist or you can provide your own.Not all doctors will require this step. That said, many will try to make sure that you have thought through the decision carefully.If you're unable to undergo HRT for any reason, seek out what you can do to live more fully in your authentic gender when and wherever you feel safe doing so.\n","Tell your doctor about your medical history.\n","Hormone therapy can increase the risk of certain medical problems, and it may interfere with certain medications. Give your doctor a full report of your entire medical history, including any past hormone treatments and current medications. Inform your doctor if you or your family have a history of breast cancer, if so you may not be a candidate for hormonal therapy.Inform your doctor about any history of cardiovascular problems (such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or heart attacks), deep vein thrombosis, blood clots, or liver disease. Hormone therapy may increase your risk of these.Make sure to tell your doctor about your mental health history as well, including any history of depression, bipolar disorder, or psychosis.\n","Undergo blood tests to determine your health.\n","These tests will help your doctor find the right medication and dosage for you. It will also ensure that you are healthy enough for hormone therapy. Your blood may be sent to a lab or tested at the office to check for: Blood count, blood lipid, and blood glucose levelsLiver functionDiabetesTestosterone levels\n","Get a prescription for female hormones and male hormone blockers.\n","You will be prescribed a form of estrogen to introduce female hormones into your body, as well as an anti-androgen to reduce male hormones. In rare cases, you may be given progesterone as well.[2]Estrogen includes estradiol, estriol, and estrone. It is the female hormone. Estrogen comes in pill, patch, or injection form.Anti-androgens (sometimes known as androgen blockers or antagonists) will reduce the effect of testosterone (the \"male\" hormone) in your body. The most common form is Spironolactone, which comes in pill form.Progesterone may sometimes be used if estrogen is not working in your body. That said, it is not commonly prescribed due to the high risk of side effects.\n","Save money to pay for the treatment.\n","HRT can cost up to $1,500 USD a year. Some insurance plans may cover the treatment, but others may not. If you have insurance, talk to your provider to see if they will cover your treatment. If not, start saving up money.Most people who start HRT will be on it for the rest of their lives. Start budgeting to include HRT as part of your lifestyle.\n","Apply an estrogen skin patch directly to the skin.\n","Estrogen is sometimes given as a skin patch. Follow the instructions on the label of your prescription to apply the patch. In most cases, you will apply the patch to dry, clean skin twice a week.[3]Patches are best for women over 40, smokers, and anyone at higher risk of developing blood clots.\n","Take a pill according to your doctors instructions.\n","Estrogen is sometimes delivered in pill form instead. Furthermore, your anti-androgens may come in pill form. Read the instructions on your medication carefully. Some pills may need to be taken every day while others will be taken every other day.[4]Pills may have varying levels of risk and effectiveness.Never take more than your prescribed dose of hormones. Taking more hormones will not speed up your transition, but it can increase your risk of complications.\n","Inject estrogen into your buttock or thigh weekly.\n","Ask your doctor to show you the proper way to inject. Before you inject, clean the syringe and your skin with an alcohol wipe. Insert the tip into the medicine bottle and hold it upside down to fill it. Press down on the plunger to fill it. Make sure to tap the syringe and press down on the plunger to release any air bubbles before injecting it.[5]Injections deliver higher doses of estrogen, but they can also increase the risk of blood clots significantly.\n","Watch out for side effects as you start therapy.\n","Every person develops differently on HRT. Some may take longer than others to develop feminine features. It is important you monitor your health for any potential side effects. Call your doctor if you notice:[6]Abdominal painNausea or vomitingHeadaches or migrainesSkin rash\n","Return to the doctor every 3 months for the first year.\n","The doctor may test your hormone levels and monitor for any side effects, such as diabetes or kidney and liver issues. Your doctor may decide to increase your estrogen or anti-androgen doses. After the first year, your doctor may only need to monitor you every 6-12 months.[7]\n","Quit smoking.\n","Smoking can reduce the effects of estrogen and increase your risk of complications. If you smoke cigarettes, talk to your doctor about quitting.\n","Watch out for a reduced sex drive.\n","HRT may reduce your sex drive and libido. If you are currently in a relationship, talk to your partner about your needs and desires. Make sure that they understand that your sex drive may decrease. If necessary, you both may want to attend couples counselling to help you work through it together.For some people, the lack of sex drive will last for as long as they take HRT.\n","Exercise to maintain muscle tone.\n","Estrogen will change the way that your body distributes fat and muscle. Women generally are less muscular than men. That said, muscle tone is important to general health. Keep exercising to maintain a healthy muscle tone.[8]\n","Get electrolysis or laser treatment to remove unwanted hair.\n","Estrogen will cause the hair on your back, face, and arms to thin, but it will rarely take it away completely. To remove hair from these areas, book an appointment with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon for electrolysis or laser hair removal treatments. It may take several treatments to remove hair completely.[9]The average cost of laser hair removal is $235 USD per session.[10]The average cost of electrolysis is between $50-100 USD an hour.\n","Create a strong support group.\n","HRT can help you feel at peace with your gender identity. That said, you may have mood swings or other side effects during this time. Tell your friends and family what to expect as you go through HRT. Ask them to help support you through the process. If you are not already going through therapy, you may want to find a mental health professional who can provide support during the process.Many LGBT centers offer support groups for people who are currently going through or considering HRT.\n","Wait 2 years before considering plastic surgery.\n","It can take up to 2 years for the full bodily effects of hormone therapy to take effect. Your breasts, hips, and face may not completely feminize until this time, and it may take a while for fat to redistribute in your body as well.[11]It used to be that people needed to spend a certain amount of time living publicly in their affirmed gender before going on hormones or being on hormones a certain length of time before having surgery, but it is now understood that these guidelines can be overly limiting and are not a fit for everyone.\n","Start breast cancer screenings 2 to 3 years after starting hormones.\n","While your risk of breast cancer is still lower than a cisgender woman, your risk will still increase. After a few years on hormones, go to your doctor for annual breast cancer screenings.[12]\n","Talk to your doctor about surgery if you want it.\n","Not everyone on HRT decides to get gender reassignment surgery, but if this option feels right to you, talk to your doctor to determine what is the best step for you. Gender reassignment surgery will remove your male genitals and reform them into female organs.[13]The removal of your testicles is a procedure called orchiectomy. After this procedure, you can start taking a lower dose of estrogen.Other surgeries that you might consider include facial feminization surgery (plastic surgery that will make your face look more feminine) and breast augmentation (to give you a fuller bosom).\n","Save up money for the surgery.\n","In some cases, insurance may cover gender reassignment surgery, but it usually wont cover feminization procedures or breast augmentation. These procedures can be very expensive.[14]Gender reassignment surgery may start at $30,000 USD.Facial feminization can start at $5,000 USD and go all the way up to $20,000.The cost of breast augmentation can vary widely but in general it can cost up around $4,000 USD.\n","Discuss if you will need to stop taking hormones before surgery.\n","Because hormones can increase the risk of blood clots, your doctor may advise you to stop taking them for 4-6 weeks before surgery takes place. You may need to wait a few weeks after the surgery to start taking them again.\n","How to Romance a Man (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Give him a massage.\n","Every man loves a massage, even if he doesn't ask for one. Many men are too shy to tell you what they really want, and if you and your man are alone and you can tell that he feels a little tense or know that he's been hunched over his desk or a computer all day, then give him a little shoulder, back, and neck massage to relieve some of that tension. He'll feel great and will see that you really care about him. This can also inspire him to give you a massage, so everybody wins!\n","Get him tickets to a game.\n","If your man is a die hard 49ers, Jets, Nets, Devils, or whatever fan, surprise him with tickets to the next game that he's been really wanting to go to. If you like sports or think he'd like the company, go with him, or even say that the tickets are just for him and his best friend, to show that you're okay with him having some guy time. He'll really appreciate the gesture and will feel like you care about him. You don't have to be a sports fanatic to be interested in the things he cares about.\n","Cook his favorite meal.\n","Don't force him to sit through two hours of home cooking when he'd rather be having a burger and fries, but do pick the right time to luxuriate over a delicious, tasty meal prepared by you and you only. You can surprise him and say that you're just making ordinary pasta and a salad when you're really preparing his favorite meal, whether it's lasagna, steak, or whatever floats his boat. Bring some fine wine or ales into the picture and your man will be floored.\n","Give him a small gift.\n","There's no need to give big, fancy and elaborate gifts to your man just to show him how much you care about him. Instead, it really is the thought that counts, and giving him a small token of your love when he least expects it can be far more powerful than the gift of a new record player. Instead, get him that record he's been trying to find forever, find him a rare t-shirt with his favorite band's logo on it, or get him a new nice ballpoint pen when his old one runs out of ink. He'll be romanced and touched by the gesture.\n","Leave him notes.\n","Nothing can make a man swoon faster than a sweet note left at the right place at the right time. Whether you're getting up and leaving the house before he does, or just leaving him a note at his place, take a minute to write him something sweet that shows that you're thinking of him and leave it in a place where he's likely to find it soon, whether it's on his computer, his mirror, or on his car window. He'll be touched by the gesture, and by the fact that you're thinking of him when you're apart. This will definitely show you care more than a text message!\n","Do him a favor.\n","When your man is busy and stressed out, take the time to notice how you can help him get through his day more easily. Whether you're washing the pile of dishes in his sink, picking up lunch, or dropping off his dry-cleaning for him, you can surprise him with the gesture, and romance him by showing you care. Sure, cleaning a pile of dirty dishes may not sound romantic, but the fact that you put some thought into helping him out will sweep him off his feet! Plus, this will give him the idea to do favors for you when you need some help in return.\n","Show up with his favorite treat.\n","Sometimes, nothing will make your man feel more romanced than if you show up at his place holding his favorite treat, whether it's the delicious deep-dish pizza form the other side of town, scones from his favorite bakery, or the delicious milkshake that he loves more than any other dessert on the planet. This will show that you're put thought into what he likes and that you've made an effort to make him happy. Bonus points if he's been holed up at home, working or studying, without having time to step out to get anything too eat.\n","Give his feet a rubdown when you're watching TV.\n","Sure, watching The New Girl or Survivor together may not feel like the most romantic time of your relationship. So why not spice it up by giving your man a nice foot massage instead of just sitting on the couch together? Put his feet on your lap and give them a nice, thorough massage, and he'll be blown away.\n","Leave him a message in the mirror.\n","When your man is taking a shower, quietly sneak in and write \"I love you\" or another sweet message in the mirror. When he gets out, he'll see your special words written over the steamy glass and will feel truly touched. This works best if the bathroom is a bit larger and you don't freak him out if he catches you in there.\n","Get him tickets to see his favorite band.\n","Check out the concert schedule for his favorite band and surprise him with tickets before he even knows they're coming to town. He'll appreciate the gesture and the effort you made to make him happy, and will definitely be romanced, even if his favorite band is decidedly something unromantic. Sometimes, getting him a gift that can lead to an amazing experience is better than a gift that can lead to instant gratification.\n","Develop some shared interests.\n","If you want to really romance a man, then you two can't just live completely separate lives. You have to make an effort to be interested in some of the same things, whether you watch the same show together or love cooking together on Wednesday nights. Finding a few things that you can both care about, and which makes both of you think about your relationship and your relationship only, can definitely make a man feel romanced. You should find something that would genuinely interest both of you instead of forcing him to take a dance class or to do something else just to please you.\n","Touch him often.\n","If you want to show your man that you really care, then you have to make an effort to touch him when you're together. This doesn't mean it has to be anything inappropriate or sexual. Just touch him on his arm, the small of his back, or on his knee when you're sitting together, or give his hand a little squeeze from time to time. You don't have to go into major PDA mode (not a favorite for many guys) to show him that you care about him and that you love being around him.\n","Give him a night with the boys.\n","There are plenty of ways to romance a man when you're not even around. Once way to show him that you really do love and care about him is to be okay with him having a night out with his boys. Don't get jealous, text him every two seconds, or ask if any women are going to be there; just show him that you trust him to behave responsibly while hanging out with his buddies. He'll see that you really do love him and want him to be happy, and will be even more excited to hang out with you the next day.\n","Compliment him\n",". Men like to feel special just as much as women do. Let him know that you think he's sexy, smart, or the most amazing man you've ever met. Whatever you're feeling, don't make him play mind reader and let him know from time to time, so he really does feel special in your presence. He'll feel like you really do care about him and like you've taken the time to think about what makes him so amazing. If you're having sex, don't be afraid to compliment him in bed, too; men love to hear it!\n","Check in with him.\n","When you're apart for a little while, don't just go MIA and make him think that you don't care about him. Without being overbearing, just give him a quick call, text, or email to ask how his day is going and to show him that you're thinking of him. This doesn't mean you should call him when he's in the middle of a crazy day at work or a stressful family situation, but that you shouldn't make him feel like you've forgotten him completely just because you're not together.\n","Ask about his outside interests.\n","Maybe your man is completely obsessed with the Lakers or Game of Thrones. It's okay if you just can't get on the bandwagon, but it doesn't mean you have to ignore his obsessions. You don't have to watch the Lakers game with him, but you can shoot him a text to see how the game went later, just to show that you're thinking of him and know it's important to him. If you see him after his TV show, ask if it was a good episode. These small questions can go a long way in making him feel like you care about him -- and the things he cares about.\n","Make eye contact.\n","It's easy to feel overwhelmed by all of the things you have to get done instead of focusing on the man you care about. However, if you want to really romance him, you have to make time just to look in his eyes, whether it's in the middle of a conversation or when you're just hanging out together. If you live together, especially, it can become habit to shout at each other from different rooms instead of really making the effort to look into each other's eyes while you're having a meaningful conversation.\n","Listen to him.\n","If you want to show that you care, then sometimes the best way you can show it is through your silence, not your words. When your man is trying to tell you something, take the time to really listen and process what he has to say instead of trying to find a solution right away or comparing what he's saying to your own experiences. Even if you feel like you've found the perfect solution for his problem, don't interrupt him and let him finish. This will show him that you really care.\n","Turn off your phone.\n","When you're out on a date or just hanging out watching TV or going for a walk, shut your phone off so you can give your man all of your attention. Nothing is more annoying than a girl who is constantly texting her friends while you're supposed to be hanging out, or who browses the web to fact-check every little thing you talk about. The next time you're together, shut that phone off for a few hours. You'll see that the world won't stop just because you can't check your Facebook or Instagram every second of your date.\n","Go on a road trip.\n","Nothing beats a spontaneous weekend road trip after a long, hard week. Plan something simple and fun, like a trip to the beach or to a wooded area a few hours south. Or maybe there's a restaurant you've both been meaning to try, though it's four hours north. Just pack up your car, make a plan, and go for it. Or don't make a plan -- just get in the car and go wherever the wind takes you. You'll see that your man really appreciates the effort you've made and will breathe some more life and fun into your relationship.\n","Do something completely different.\n","Plan something totally new for the two of you to do together, whether you're taking a sushi making class, learning Japanese together, or doing partner yoga for the first time. It doesn't have to lead to any major self-discovery or achievement, and you never have to do it again; just making the effort to try new things from time to time can go a long way in helping your relationship stay fresh and in continuing to keep up the romance.\n","Get dressed up.\n","You shouldn't put on a ball gown if you're just sitting around the house all day, but if you're going on a date or just hanging out outside the home, make an effort to look nice and maintain your appearance so that your man sees that you've made an effort. You should both dress up to keep the romance alive and to maintain the passion and attraction of your relationship. And if you're not going anywhere fancy, to try to still maintain your appearance to show that you do care and so you both don't get complacent.\n","Convince him to dance.\n","Yeah, so most guys don't love the idea of taking ballroom dancing lessons with their ladies, but if you're out at a bar or a club and the music is pumping, drag him onto the dance floor for a song or two. Just moving your bodies together and enjoying the beats you hear will help you let loose and have a great time together. This will definitely kick up the passion and romance factor.\n","Surprise him.\n","To keep things interesting and to make sure your man always feels romanced, you should surprise him from time to time. A little unpredictability never hurt anyone, and if you plan a surprise picnic, surprise trip, or just a surprise activity you would never dream of doing before, your man will feel like he has been truly swept off his feet. Make an effort to do something spontaneous, completely unexpected, and incredibly exciting at least every few weeks just to keep stoking the embers of your romance.\n","How to Crochet Hair: An Easy Step-by-Step Tutorial\n","Wash, condition, and moisturize your hair ahead of time.\n","Go through your hair with both clarifying shampoo and moisturizing shampoo, followed by a round of moisturizing conditioner. Once your hair is squeaky clean, use a moisturizing product like mousse or leave-in conditioner to nourish your hair.[1]Although its totally optional, some people like to do a pre-shampoo treatment with olive or coconut oil before washing their hair.\n","Part your hair into 2 front sections and 1 larger back section.\n","Grab the end of a rat-tail comb and split your hair vertically along your part. Using the same comb, part your hair again, guiding it in a horizontal line from one ear to the other. Clip up the front 2 sections of your hair so you can focus on the larger, back section of hair first.[2]If you have a widows peak along your hairline, it could be worth parting your hair slightly unevenly. That way, your widows peak looks a little more polished.It might help to stretch your natural hair before you start braiding.\n","Cornrow the back section of your hair\n","in horizontal lines. Starting along the very bottom of your neck, braid your hair in a horizontal line thats parallel with your shoulders. Once you braid all the way across your neck, braid the hair into a curve and continue working your way to the other side of your head. Keep snaking this braid up along the back of your head until youve used up all the hair in the back section.[3]It helps to part the back portion of your hair into smaller sections before you start making your horizontal cornrows.\n","Secure the end of your braid into the nearby braids with your crochet latch hook.\n","Insert your hook beneath one of the horizontal cornrows near the top of the back section. Slide the braid tail through the latch hook, using the hook to thread the tail through the base braid. Continue weaving this tail until its completely tucked in; this way, your horizontal braids are completely flat against your head.[4]\n","Braid your front 2 sections of hair in vertical lines going back.\n","Unclip your hair in the front and divide it  into smaller sections. Ideally, try to make about 15-18 braids along the front of your head that trail all the way to the back (already braided) portion of your hair.[5]Make sure that your braids are spaced out evenly.\n","Weave the tail ends of your front braids into your back horizontal braids.\n","Like you did before, use your crochet latch hook to tuck the ends of your front braids into the base braids so all your natural hair is flat.[6] Make sure that youre threading each braid tail into different sections of your hair; otherwise, youll create a disproportionately large lump of hair along the back of your head.[7]\n","Apply hair growth oil to your braids to promote hair growth.\n","Grab a bottle of hair growth or edge growth oil and squeeze it along the edges of your braids. Feel free to apply the oil all around your scalp, or focus it in areas where youd really like to target hair growth.[8]Applying oil helps your scalp stay moisturized while your crocheted extensions are in place.[9]\n","Start with the back section of your hair and finish with the front sections.\n","Find the lowest horizontal braid along the back of your headthis is your starting point. Youll work your way through the back section of your hair first, followed the front sections.[10]\n","Insert the crochet hook through a braid and latch the hair extension.\n","Stick the hook through the bottom of the cornrow, making sure that latch is poking out from the bottom of the hair. Then, fold a small section of your hair extension in half and loop it onto the latch.[11]\n","Pull the loose hair or braid through the cornrow by about 3in (7.6cm).\n","With the latch closed around the hair extension or loop, pull the hook back under and through the cornrow. Go slowly to avoid snagging your natural hair on the way through.[12]Keep in mind that there may be some resistance if you are crocheting thick, curly or wavy hair extensions. Go slowly to avoid damaging your natural hair or the extensions.\n","Open up the loop of hair with your fingers and pull the ends through.\n","Slide the loop of hair onto your fingertips and set aside the latch hook. Then, slide the loose ends of the hair extension through this loop and tug it taut to create a knot.[13]To make your extensions extra secure, thread the ends of your extension through the loop twice.[14]If youre crocheting with braid extensions, insert the crochet latch hook into your natural braid and slide the looped end of the braid extension down the base of the crochet latch hook. Then, hook the opposite end of the braid extension in the latch and pull it through the looped end to secure the extension to your scalp.[15]\n","Continue crocheting along the rest of the horizontal braid.\n","Place your fingertip next to the extension you just addedthis is the amount of space you want between each braid. Repeating the same technique, use your crochet latch hook to thread a small, folded section of extension further along the braid. Create a loop with one end of the tendril, thread the ends through, and tighten the knot.[16]\n","Move up to the next layer to continue adding extensions.\n","Work your way up the back of your head and transition to the front sections. Use the same crocheting technique on the most of these front sectionsjust be sure to space your extensions a little closer together.[17]You dont have to use quite as much synthetic hair as you work your way to the front of your head.[18]\n","Pull just 1 end of your extension through the loop near your hairline and part.\n","Insert the latch hook through the braid and attach the extension piece like you normally would. This time, however, slide just 1 end of the extension through the loop and pull it taut (rather than both ends). This creates a more natural-looking knot along the more visible parts of your hair.[19]\n","Snip any frizzy or uneven ends to finetune and shape your hairstyle.\n","Grab a pair of hair shears and cut away bad-looking ends. Once youve given your hair a quick tune-up, your beautiful new look is ready to go![20]\n","Remove your extensions after 4-8 weeks.\n","Crocheted extensions last for a long time, but they can potentially lead to breakage if you keep them in for more than 8 weeks. Thankfully, this process doesnt take super longit can as little as 20 minutes, depending on the style and number of extensions you used.\n","Snip off the hair extensions without cutting off the base knots.\n","Grab a pair of hair shears and line them up on top of the knotted base of your hair extensions. Then, make your cut, leaving just the knotted bottoms of the extensions in place.[21]It helps to snip off all the extensions before you start removing the knots from your natural hair.You can also snip off most of the extension (rather than the entire strand) and undo the knot by hand.[22]\n","Undo the end of your natural braid until you come across a knotted extension.\n","Using the end of a rat-tail comb, separate the end of your natural hair from its braid. Keep unraveling the braid until you reach the first knotted extension base.[23]\n","Coat the knot with grapeseed oil and slip it off your natural hair.\n","Apply a lot of oil to the extension so it slides off your natural hair without any trouble. You might need to shimmy the knot a little bit before it slides off.[24]\n","Repeat this process until all of the extension knots are removed.\n","Keep snipping off your extensions directly above the knots, undoing your braids, and sliding the knots off. Chances are, some of the knots will fall out on their own, so you wont have to remove every single extension by hand.[25]\n","How to Make Felt Balls: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Make a small, round wad of wool with your fingers.\n","To start making the felt ball, pull off a small chunk of wool felt about 23 inches (5.17.6cm) big and form it into a roundish shape. It wont be a perfect ball, but will roughly resemble a large puffball.[1]Stretch out the piece of felt so there arent any large clumps or pockets of material, then form it into a round wad of wool.\n","Wrap a length of wool tightly around it.\n","Take another strip of wool felt about 56 inches (1315cm) long and wrap the entire length of it around the small ball wad of wool. Wrap it tightly around the wad to form a solid core for your felt ball.[2]The wool should start to adhere to itself as you wind it around the wad in the center.Dont worry about adding different color wool at this point because you wont be able to see it when the felt ball is finished.\n","Add layers of wool until the ball is twice the size that you want it to be.\n","The felt ball will shrink to almost half of its original size when its finished. Keep adding layers until your fluffy felt ball is about twice as large as you want it to be when its done.[3]Try to keep the ball as round as possible while youre adding layers of wool felt to it.\n","Mix 4 tablespoons (59mL) of liquid dish soap and 6 cups (1.4L) of hot water.\n","The key to getting the wool felt to turn into a dense little ball is using hot water and soap to shrink and compact the material. Fill a bowl with hot water and mix in the dish soap. Stir the bowl to form a soapy mixture.[4]The water doesnt need to be so hot that it can burn you, but it does need to be very warm in order to shrink the wool.\n","Submerge the ball of wool into the soap solution to fully saturate it.\n","You dont need to hold the ball under the water for a long time, just dip it in long enough to soak the ball completely. Hold the felt ball under the water for about 2-3 seconds.[5]Gently shake the ball to remove the excess water from it.\n","Hold the ball in between your palms and rub them in a circular motion.\n","Gently roll the ball of wool in the palms of your hands to form it into a perfectly round sphere. Pass the ball of wool back and forth from hand to hand for 10 minutes.[6]\n","Dip the felt ball into the water when it cools down.\n","As youre rolling the ball of wool back and forth between your hands, submerge it back into the hot water whenever it cools down. Keeping the wool felt drenched in hot, soapy water is the key to forming the perfect felt ball.[7]Submerge the felt ball in hot water every 2-3 minutes or whenever it starts to feel cold.\n","Insert strips of colored wool into the ball the make stripes.\n","Take a strip of differently colored wool felt and work it into the wet felt ball with your fingertips. Soak the ball in the hot, soapy water and roll it in your hands. The stripe will start to smooth out and become a part of the felt ball![8]Try using multiple colors of wool felt to form different stripes.Form a zigzag pattern by inserting the wool strip with your fingertips and creating a staircase pattern across the ball.\n","Wind bits of wool into a circle to add dots to the ball.\n","To add different colored dots to your felt ball, pull off a small piece of wool felt and roll it into a small ball. Flatten the ball with your fingertips and stick it into you felt ball. Then soak the ball in the hot water and roll it around in your hands until its smooth.[9]Use multiple colors to make a wacky polka-dot felt ball!\n","Stop when the felt ball shrinks to the size that you want.\n","Once the ball reaches the size you want it to be, immediately stop rolling it or it will continue to shrink. Do not submerge it back into the hot water or it will take longer to dry and will shrink even more.[10]\n","Rinse the ball with cool water and allow it to air dry.\n","After youve stopped rolling the felt ball, rinse it under cool water in the sink to remove the hot water and soap. Then, place it on a plate and allow it to dry for about 1-2 hours, or until its dry to the touch.[11]Dont let the felt ball dry in the sunlight or near something hot or it will shrink even further as it dries.\n","Add glitter to your felt ball to make it sparkle.\n","After your felt ball is dry, add some craft glue to the ball and sprinkle on some glitter to add a little bit of sparkly flair. Use your fingertips to work the glitter into the wool felt.[12]Some glitter may come off, but most of it will adhere to the craft glue on the wool.\n","How to Make a Mastectomy Bra from a Regular Bra: 15 Steps\n","Use a comfortable, full-coverage bra for this project.\n","Full-coverage bras are usually wireless, made of breathable fabric, and have full cups that cover the entirety of your breasts. Try on the bra to make sure the neckline fits close against your skin and the cups can support the size and weight of your prosthesis.[1]Avoid tight-fitting bras and sports bras. Compressing scar tissue is uncomfortable and may prevent lymph fluids from draining properly.[2]Choose a bra with minimal padding for the best fit.If youre having trouble finding a bra that fits properly after your mastectomy, just know that this is pretty common and you aren't alone. Try booking an appointment with an experienced bra fitter to help you out. They can take exact measurements, offer advice, and help you select the best post-surgery bra for you.[3]\n","Put a sheet of paper on a flat surface and lay a foam breast form on top.\n","A regular piece of white printer paper works fine for this. Place it on a flat table or ironing board and position a foam breast form in the center. If your prosthesis is made of foam or fiber fill, it's totally fine to use it for this since foam is durable.[4]Don't use a silicone prosthesis for this part, though! The pins can damage it.If you had a mastectomy without immediate reconstructive surgery, your nurse probably sent you home with a temporary foam insert. You can use that for this.[5]If you dont have a foam breast form, stuff the bra cup with fiber fill in the next step. Fill up the cup completely! You can buy fiber fill at craft stores.\n","Place your bra over the foam breast form so it fills the bra cup properly.\n","Unhook the closure and place one of the bra cups face-up directly over the foam breast form. Shape and adjust the cup with your hands until the foam fills up the cup properly. Smooth out the bra with your hand so the cup seams are resting flat against the paper.[6]You can tape the bra to the paper if youre worried it might shift around as youre pinning the bra.[7]\n","Stick straight pins around the edges of the cup to attach it to the paper.\n","Start by pinning around the bottom seam of the bra, spacing the pins about 1in (2.5cm) apart. Be sure to stick each pin through both the fabric and paper. Pin along the center front of the cup, between the strap and underarm, and finish with the neckline edge.[8]If the neckline has lace, stick the pins near the outer edge of the lace.Dont pin the underarm seam! Leave that part of the cup open and unpinned.\n","Take out the pins and draw a line to connect the holes on the paper.\n","Pull out the straight pins and move the bra out of the way. Grab a pencil or pen and lightly sketch a line to connect the pin holes. The outline doesnt have to be perfect, so dont sweat it! Just connect the dots.[9]Since you didnt pin the underarm seam, there should be a space there.\n","Put the foam form on the paper and sketch the underarm seam.\n","Put the form back into place exactly how you had it. Using the edge of the form as reference, sketch a straight line from the underarm to bottom seam line. The line should skim the outer edge of the form.[10]This line closes the gap in the pattern. Remove the form when youre done.If you used fiber fill instead of a foam form, ditch the fill and use your silicone prosthesis for this since no pins are involved.\n","Draw a semi-circle connecting the underarm and bottom seam.\n","Place the tip of a pencil at the center of the straight line you just drew. Move the pencil 1.25in (3.2cm) to the right and draw a dot on the paper. Draw a semi-circle to connect the underarm, center dot, and bottom seam.[11]You can trace the round edge of a can (like hairspray) to create the semi-circle.Erase the straight line so you dont get confused when you're cutting the pattern.\n","Cut out the paper pattern along the lines you drew.\n","Your pattern is almost done! Just use sharp scissors to cut along the connected dots and get rid of the excess paper. Remember to cut out the underarm along the semi-circle you drew, not the straight line you originally sketched there.[12]\n","Cut a 8in 16in (20cm 41cm) rectangle of knit cotton fabric.\n","Measure out a rectangle of fabric; your measurements don't have to be perfect or exact, though! Consider using white or flesh-toned fabric for this. The fabric wont be visible when youre wearing your bra, but dark fabrics might show through a white bra cup.[13]Any soft, stretchy material, like cotton/spandex or nylon/spandex blends, will work for this project.[14]\n","Fold the fabric in half and pin the paper pattern to it.\n","Place the folded fabric rectangle on a flat surface in front of you. Lay the paper pattern on top of the fabric and attach it to the fabric with straight pins. Be sure to stick the pins through both layers of fabric and the paper.[15]A double-layered pocket provides plenty of support for your prosthesis.\n","Cut the fabric around the pattern and remove the pins.\n","Use sharp scissors to trim the fabric, taking care to cut through both layers, and remove the pins. This is enough for 1 bra pocket. If you had a double mastectomy, use the pattern to cut a second piece of fabric for the other bra cup.[16]The semi-circular edge of fabric goes on the outer edge of each bra cup. For the right breast, the semi-circle will form a C shape. For the left breast, it will be an inverted C. Labeling the left and right cups now might prevent confusion later on.[17]\n","Pin the pocket in the bra cup with the semi-circle facing the outer edge.\n","Position the double-layered fabric pocket inside your bra cup, lining up the edges so the semi-circle is on the outer edge facing the underarm. Stick pins around the cup's edge, going through the both layers of fabric and the cup. Space the pins about 1in (2.5cm) apart, leaving the semi-circle unpinned. [18]Remember, the semi-circle creates the opening for the breast form.Leave the fabric folded in half when you pin it into your bra cup.\n","Sew a medium zig-zag stitch around the outer edge of the cup.\n","Thread your sewing machine with matching thread and position the needle at the bottom point of the semi-circle. Use a medium zig-zag stitch to carefully sew around the outer edge of the cup. Remove the pins as you go and stop when you reach the top point of the semi-circle.[19]Use a stretch needle or a universal needle for this.\n","Slide the breast form into the pocket to test out the fit.\n","Push your prosthesis or foam breast form through the opening of the pocket and adjust it until it's filling the cup properly without bunching up or wrinkling.[20]The outer edge of the breast form will stick out of the pocket a tiny bit. This is normal and makes it easy to remove and insert the prosthesis whenever you want.\n","Backstitch to close the seam and cut the thread to finish the pocket.\n","If youre happy with the fit, take out the foam form and reverse the stitch to close the seam. Trim the thread and repeat the process on the other side if youre doing both bra cups. Then, pop in the form(s) and try on your new bra!Your bra should be comfortable and your breasts should look balanced. If your breasts look uneven, adjust the bra straps or change the position of the insert(s) until you're happy with the way everything looks.If youre not happy with the pocket position, use a seam ripper to remove the stitches, readjust the pocket, and sew it back into your bra cup. If the fit is too tight, remove the stitches and sew it into your bra again using a looser stitch.\n","How to Make a Ginger Hair Mask: 10 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Gather ingredients and tools.\n","Making a ginger hair mask is simple, but it does require some special ingredients and tools. To make a basic ginger hair mask, you will need:[2]fresh gingercoconut oila vegetable peelera bowla gratera sieve or colandera spooncotton ballsa shower cap or plastic wrap\n","Peel and grate the ginger.\n","To help you extract the juice from the ginger, you will need to peel and grate it. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the ginger and discard the peels. Then, use the fine side of a box grater to grate the ginger directly into your sieve.[3]Place the bowl under the sieve to collect any juice that runs out as you are grating the ginger.\n","Strain the juice from the ginger.\n","Use your spoon to press the ginger against the bottom of the sieve. Keep pressing different spots until you have pressed most of the juice out of the ginger. After you have gotten plenty of juice into your bowl, you can discard the ginger pulp or use it for something else.[4]\n","Mix in the coconut oil.\n","Pour in a generous amount of coconut oil. Make sure that you use more coconut oil than ginger. Stir the oil and ginger together until they are well-combined.[5]Aim for two or three parts coconut oil and one part ginger juice. If there is more ginger than oil, then the ginger may sting your scalp.If your coconut oil is solid, then warm it slightly to liquefy it, but do not allow it to get hot. Placing your coconut oil in a pan over low heat should be enough to turn it into a liquid.\n","Add boosters if desired.\n","While ginger and coconut oil make a great simple hair mask, you may also consider adding some boosters to make your mask even more effective. Some ingredients that seem to promote hair growth and health include:Green tea. Green tea may help to stimulate hair growth.[6] Try adding a cup of fresh brewed green tea to your mixture.Onion juice. Onion juice has been shown to promote hair growth in people with hair loss.[7] Try grating an onion and adding the juice to your mixture.Garlic. Garlic has been shown to stimulate hair growth as well.[8] Try peeling and grating a few garlic cloves and adding them to your mask mixture.\n","Test a small amount of the ginger mask on your skin.\n","Before you put the ginger mask all over your scalp, you should test it on a small area of your scalp or on your inner wrist. After you apply the ginger, wait about 30 minutes and then check the area.If you notice any redness or irritation, then do not use the ginger mask on your scalp. You may be allergic or at least sensitive to the ginger.\n","Apply the ginger mask to all areas of your scalp.\n","If your skin looked and felt fine after your spot test, then go ahead and use the cotton balls to apply the ginger mask to your entire scalp. Soak a cotton ball in the mask and then press the cotton ball against your scalp. Keep soaking and pressing until your entire scalp is covered in the mask.[9]\n","Give yourself a three minute scalp massage.\n","After your scalp is coated in the ginger mask, use your fingertips to give yourself a three minute scalp massage.[10] To massage your scalp, press your finger pads (not your nails) into your scalp and rub your scalp with small circular motions.[11]Do not scratch your scalp when you have the ginger mask on your skin. Scraping your skin while you have ginger on it will hurt.\n","Put on your shower cap, plastic bag, or plastic wrap.\n","After you finish your scalp massage, put on the shower cap, plastic bag or plastic wrap. Make sure that the plastic covers your entire scalp and all of your hair as well. Otherwise, ginger and oil may drip onto your clothes while you wait.[12]\n","Leave the mask on for 20 minutes.\n","Allow the mask to stay on your scalp for 20 minutes so that it can fully penetrate into your scalp. Set a timer and relax.[13]If the mask starts to burn, itch, or irritate your scalp, then wash it off your scalp right away.After your time is up, rinse, shampoo and condition your hair as you normally would.\n","How to Treat Tapeworm in Dogs: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Figure out if your dog is at risk for tapeworm.\n","Some dogs are more at risk than others of picking up tapeworms. To become infected the dog needs contact with an \"intermediate\" host. These intermediate hosts are fleas and vermin, such as mice and rats.[2]If your dog has fleas, there is a good chance it could acquire a tapeworm infection. If it grooms itself and swallows a flea its digestive juices will break down the protective shell of the egg packet and release the eggs into the bowel, where they grow into an adult tapeworms.Likewise if the dog is a hunter or scavenger and eats mice or rats, he will ingest tapeworm larvae that have formed cysts within the vermin's body tissue, and when the dog eats the encysted larvae they can go on to become adult tapeworms.A dog cannot become infected by contact with the egg packets passed from his own anus, because the egg packets need to pass through the intermediate host to reach the stage where they are infectious to dogs.\n","Look for tapeworm eggs.\n","The most obvious sign your dog has tapeworm is if you see the tapeworm eggs packet near the dog's anus or on its bedding. These egg packets can be white, creamy, golden, or gray colored, and vary in size between a cucumber seed and a sesame seed.[3]They are variously described as looking like a small grain of rice or sesame seeds. If the eggs are newly passed, if you look closely you may see them wriggling. If the eggs are older they dry out and then look more like sesame seeds.The life cycle of the tapeworm means the adult worm within the dog's gut, releases these egg packets (also called proglottids)  intermittently. These then migrate down through the gut and out of the dog's anus, ready to contaminate the environment and be a source of infection for the intermediate hosts (fleas or vermin).\n","Pay attention if your dog is dragging its bottom along the ground.\n","This migration irritates the lining of the rectum and anus, making it itchy and causing some dogs to scoot their bottoms along the ground.[4] However, be aware that scooting can have other reasons beside tapeworm infection, such as full anal sacs or allergic skin conditions.[5]\n","Take your dog to the vet if you suspect tapeworm.\n","Your vet can check for tapeworm infection by examining a fecal sample under a microscope to look for tapeworm eggs. However, it is possible to get false negatives because the adult tapeworm does not shed proglottids (the packet contained eggs) all the time but does so intermittently.[6]\n","Give your dog a deworming medicine.\n","Tapeworms are destroyed by specific deworming preparations containing the active ingredient praziquantel. This drug works by making the outer membrane of the tapeworm leaky, which allows nutrients to leak out and the tapeworm to die.[7]A new drug is now available, Epsiprantel, which has a similar activity to praziquantel, but is not yet in widespread use.Praziquantel is effective against all species of tapeworm, which makes it your first choice dewormer. However, a different drug called dichlorophen has limited action and will destroy 2 of the 3 main tapeworm species. Unfortunately the species it doesn't kill is Echinococcus, which under exceptional circumstances can be a risk to human health and is therefore not such a good choice.\n","Be aware that not all deworming products contain praziquantel.\n","Always check the packaging to see if they are covered. Look for specific wording on the pack that says the product is effective against tapeworms and check that praziquantel is among the active ingredients. For example, a product such as Panacur contains fenbendazole only, which is not effective against tapeworm.[8]The drawback of praziquantel is that it is not effective against roundworms and other common worms, therefore many deworming tablets are made up of two deworming ingredients. For example, Drontal contains praziquantel and pyrantel, Milbemax contains praziquantel and milbemycin, and Prazitel Plus contains pyrantel, praziquantel, and febantel.Also be aware that many common spot-on parasite treatments that are highly effective against other species, do NOT work against tapeworm.\n","Give your dog the proper dosage of medication.\n","Tapeworm treatments are most widely available in tablet form. Accurately weigh your dog, if necessary visit a veterinary clinic and weigh the dog on the scale there. Then carefully follow the dosage instruction on the packaging to make sure the dog has the correct dose.[9]Be aware that the medication kills any infection the dog currently has, but the treatment has no lasting effect and therefore does not protect the dog against repeat infection.There is also an injectable form of praziquantel, Droncit. This injection can sting and if you have a large dog it will need a relatively large volume of injection, which can be uncomfortable.\n","Follow your veterinarian's directions for how long and how often to give tapeworm medication.\n","How often to give your dog a tapeworm treatment is controversial and usually judged on an individual basis. If your dog is in a high risk group, such as a hunting dog or a dog that has regular flea infestations, then monthly tapeworming is advisable. If your dog is at low risk such as an indoor dog that has regular flea treatments then speak to your vet and follow their advice.[10]\n","Prevent future tapeworm infection.\n","[11] A large part of preventing infection is removing access to the intermediate hosts. This is done through regular monthly treatments with an effective flea product to ensure your dog does not harbor the intermediate host.[12]Also, prevent access to vermin or carcasses so that the dog cannot scavenge and eat the encysted larval forms.\n","4 Ways to Whiten Yellow Hair - wikiHow\n","Use a toner after bleaching.\n","Dark hair often ends up with orange or yellow tones after bleaching. The right toner will cancel out these brassy tones and makes your hair closer to  platinum or white blonde.[1]\n","Find purple toner in a drugstore or beauty supply store.\n","Just about any pharmacy should carry toner, and you might even find it in the hair product aisle of a supermarket. You can also find purple toner at your local beauty supply store. Pick a purple or violet toner to remove yellow tones.

Mix this with the toner according to label instructions.Green toner will cancel out reddish tones, and blue toner will cancel out orange tones. However, without a corrector, but these toners will leave your hair yellow, not white.\n","Use a color wheel to help you choose the right toner.\n","If youre not sure what color of toner or corrector to choose, look at a color wheel. Find the color that matches your hair best, and look at the color directly opposite from it on the color wheel to find the complementary shade. Your toner or corrector should match the color that complements the tones in your hair.\n","Mix with a creme developer.\n","Choose a developer with 30 volume or less. High volume developers may make bleached hair weak or even cause it to fall out.\n","Apply according to label instructions.\n","Check the toner label to find out how long you need to leave it on your hair. Leaving it in too long can make your hair purple, so don't overdo it.Alternatively, a very easy option is to simply book an appointment with a hairdresser for a toner to be put in.

If you are alone but can move safely, go for help. Most snake bites aren't dangerous, but when you do get bitten by a venomous snake, getting medical care as soon as possible is imperative. First responders will know the types of snakes found in the area and will be best equipped for the most appropriate treatment. Either call paramedics or get to an emergency room right away.You will not necessarily be able to determine if a snake bite is from a venomous snake by just looking at the bite. It is best to get medical help right away, no matter what the bite looks like.Remain as calm as possible. Panic will increase your heart rate and if the snake is venomous, the increased heart rate will just spread the venom through your body faster.[1] Try and stay as calm and quiet as possible.If you're able to, call the National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for advice while you wait.[2]\n","Take note of the snake's appearance.\n","[3] First responders and emergency physicians will need the description in order to determine if the snake was venomous. If possible, get a picture of the snake or at least have a fellow hiker also take a mental picture of the snake to verify what you've seen.Dont try to catch the snake-- snakes are very fast and unless you are an experienced snake catcher, they have the advantage.Don't walk toward the snake or spend a lot of time trying to get a better look at it if you are still in harm's way. This is not safe. Simply look at the snake quickly and then move away.\n","Move away from the snake.\n","You should immediately get out of the snake's range, so you don't get bitten a second time. Get to a safe spot a fair distance away from the site where the bite occurred. However, do not run away or move too far. Your heart will start pumping faster if you move too quickly, spreading the venom more quickly through your body.Move to a place where the snake is not likely to return. Find a flat boulder a bit above the path, a clearing, or another area without a lot of hiding places for snakes.Try to remain as still as possible once you have reached a safer area.\n","Immobilize and support the area of the bite.\n","Do not apply a tourniquet but do restrict movement in the bitten area. Also keep the area at or below the level of your heart. This will help make sure that if it was a venomous snake the spread of the venom is slowed down.Keeping the bitten part of you below the level of your heart slows down the flow of any affected blood towards the heart, which would then pump the venom throughout your body.[4]If you can, fashion a splint to keep the area surrounding the bite from moving. Use sticks or boards and place them on either side of the bite area. Then tie a piece of cloth at the bottom, middle, and top of the boards to keep them in place.\n","Remove clothing, jewelry, or constricting items.\n","Bites from venomous snakes can cause rapid and severe swelling. Even a loose piece of clothing can become too tight as the bite area swells.\n","Clean the wound as best as you can, but dont flush it with water.\n","Take a clean cloth soaked in water and clean the wound gently but as thoroughly as possible.  When the wound is clean, cover it with a clean cloth.\n","Wait for, or go for, medical help.\n","The best you can do is find medical help as soon as possible. The good news is that once you have cleaned the wound and have removed any jewelry, if there is little or no swelling, the bite is less likely to be from a venomous snake. However, even if this is the case there is still a risk of infection or a serious reaction, including allergic reactions, so you still need medical attention as soon as possible.\n","Avoid steps that will worsen your situation.\n","There are a lot of myths about how to care for a snake bite and some of these myths could actually make your situation worse.Don't try to cut or suck the venom out. Cutting the wound could cause more problems and increases the risk of infection.  Anyone sucking out venom may actually swallow some and be poisoned themselves.Dont use a tourniquet or use ice on the wound. Experts believe that a tourniquet could potentially restrict blood flow too much and ice can increase the damage to the wound.[5][6]Dont drink any alcohol or caffeine-- this can increase your heart rate and spread any venom that may be there.  Instead, stay hydrated with water.\n","Understand the medical care you should receive.\n","At the ER, you will be treated for swelling, pain and any symptoms of a venomous snake bite. These symptoms include nausea, dizziness, numbness and any difficulty breathing or swallowing. The ER will also observe you for drops in blood pressure, any signs of damage to the blood or nervous system, allergic reactions, and swelling.The treatment will depend on any symptoms you develop.  If no symptoms develop, you may still be kept for a 24-hour observation period because in some cases it takes that long for symptoms to develop.If the snake that bit you is venomous, you may get treated with antivenin (aka antivenom or antivenene). This is a combination of antibodies made to counteract snake toxins and has been shown to be safe and effective in both adults and children. Depending on symptoms, you may get more than one dose.You will also likely be prescribed a broad-spectrum antibiotic to make sure the wound does not get infected. A tetanus shot may also be given.For very severe snake bites, surgery may be required.\n","Follow recommendations for continued care of the bite.\n","By the time you are released from the hospital, your main concern should be keeping the snake bite area cleaned and covered and following medical instructions for wound care. These instructions should include how often to change the dressing, how to clean the healing wound (usually warm water and soap), and how to recognize a possible infection.Signs of possible infection include swelling, tenderness, redness, drainage, and heat coming from the infected area, or a new fever. If you experience any of these symptoms at the site of the snake bite, call your physician as soon as possible.\n","Stay calm and wait it out if you cannot reach medical care.\n","If you're out in the wilderness, with no hope of paramedics getting there soon, the best you can do is get as comfortable as possible and wait for the venom to leave your system. In most cases, snakes don't inject enough venom for the bite to be fatal. Treat the individual symptoms that may occur, and most importantly, stay calm and move as little as possible. Fear of snakes and the anxiety that follows being bitten are often what leads to fatalities, since a pounding heart makes the venom spread more quickly.If you're out hiking and see other people, ask if they can call or go for help, or if they have a snake-bite kit of pump suction device.\n","Stop the bleeding.\n","Bites from non-venomous snakes are unlikely to be life threatening, but they still require first aid treatment to prevent infection. Treat a non-venomous snake bite like a puncture wound; the first step is to apply firm pressure to the wound with a sterile gauze or bandage, so you don't lose too much blood.Don't treat the bite as a non-venomous bite unless you're absolutely sure that the snake was not venomous. If there's any doubt, it's important to get medical attention right away.\n","Clean the wound carefully.\n","Wash it with clean water and soap for several minutes. Rinse the wound thoroughly with more water, then wash it again. Pat it dry with a sterile piece of gauze.[7] Use an alcohol-soaked pad if one is available.\n","Treat the wound with an antibiotic ointment and a bandage.\n","Apply a thin coating of antibiotic ointment to the clean wound. Then bandage the wound. This will protect it and help to prevent infection.\n","Seek medical attention.\n","Your doctor will make sure that the bite is cleaned and cared for properly. Feel free to ask him or her if further medical care is needed, including whether or not you need a tetanus shot.[8]\n","Pay attention to the wound as it heals.\n","Even non-venomous snake bites may lead to infection. Look for any signs of infection such as redness, streaking, swelling, drainage, or  a fever. If you see any, return to your doctor to get it checked out.\n","Drink plenty of fluids as you heal.\n","It's important to stay properly hydrated as your body heals from the snakebite. In general, you should aim to drink about 2 liters of water per day.[9]\n","Learn about venomous snakes.\n","Most snakes are not venomous, but all snakes can bite.[10] The most common venomous snakes are cobras, copperheads, coral snakes, cottonmouths (water moccasins) and rattlesnakes. While most venomous snakes have a triangular shaped head, the only real way to know if a snake is venomous is to be able to identify it or locate the fang glands on a dead snake.[11]\n","Determine if you are in a region where venomous snakes live.\n","Cobras are found in Asia and Africa. Copperheads are found in the southern and eastern portions of the US, and parts of Australia and Asia. Varieties of coral snakes can be found in the southern US, parts of India and SE Asia, China, and Taiwan. Cottonmouths, or water moccasins, are found in the Southeast US and rattlesnakes range from the southern parts of Canada and extend all the way down into Argentina.Certain areas of the world, such as Australia, have a higher concentration of highly venomous snakes than others. Remember that venomous snakes can and do live in cities as well as the wilderness, and exercise appropriate caution.\n","Learn about snake bites.\n","When a non-venomous snake bites, the biggest concern is infection and tissue swelling.  When venomous snakes bite, in addition to tissue damage and infection, the concern is the effects of the snake venom.  Most snakes will not bite unless they are disturbed or handled by people.Fangs in snakes can be fixed or folded back until the snake bites. Venomous snakes can have either type of fang, although snakes with fixed fangs, such as the coral snake, tend to affect the nervous system, while those with folded fangs, such as rattlesnakes, tend to affect blood cells.[12][13]All types of snakes have substances that can cause tissue destruction-- if you get bitten by a snake, limiting this damage may be the most critical problem.\n","Understand the behavior of snakes.\n","Snakes are cold-blooded, meaning they get their body heat from their surroundings and the sun. Because of this, snakes and snake bites are much less common in cooler climates or colder seasons because the snakes are hibernating.Snakes and snake bites are more common the closer you get to the equator because the snakes found in these areas dont hibernate and are more active during the hotter days.\n","Avoid contact with snakes.\n","The best way to treat a snake bite is to avoid a snake bite. According to wilderness experts, here are the best ways to avoid snakes and their bites:Dont sleep or rest next to areas where snakes may be hiding. This includes brush, tall grass, big rocks, and trees.Dont poke your hands into rock crevices, hollow logs, heavy brush, or any place a snake may be waiting for its next meal.Look down as you walk through any brush or tall grass.Dont try to pick up any snake, dead or alive.  Snakes have a reflex where they can bite for a minute or so after they are dead...strange but true!ALWAYS wear hiking boots to cover your ankles and keep your pants legs tucked into your boots.Make noise. Most snakes dont want to see you anymore than you want to see them![14] To ensure that you don't scare a snake, make sure they can hear you coming.\n","Purchase a snakebite kit.\n","If you are a frequent hiker or wilderness explorer, consider investing in a snakebite kit that includes a pump suction device. Do not use kits that include razor blades or suction bulbs.[15]\n","How to Make a Care Package for Your Boyfriend: 13 Steps\n","Determine your budget.\n","Its easy to get out of hand with buying gifts for someone you care about, so stay firm on your budget. Remember that the most meaningful items for your boyfriend will likely be those that are sentimental in nature, and that the effort behind your care package will mean a lot to him, too.Make sure you factor in shipping costs to your budget. The heavier and bulkier your box is, the more expensive your shipping will be. You will also pay shipping costs based on how far the box needs to travel. You can get an estimate of what youll pay for shipping on your shipping companys website.[1]\n","Figure out when you need to ship it.\n","If you want to get the gift to him on a certain day, pay attention to shipping dates. The closer to the deadline you ship it, the more expensive it will be or the less likely it is to get there on time.During holidays, shipping companies and post offices will usually indicate a ship by date to help you determine when you should mail your package in order for it to arrive in time for the holiday. You can check with your preferred carrier to help you determine your shipping deadline.\n","Research shipping regulations.\n","Make sure you know what you can and cannot send through the mail. If your boyfriend is in the military, he may be subject to additional regulations about what he can receive in the mail.Make sure your package doesnt include prohibited items, including weapons, explosives, and alcohol. Policies vary by shipping company, so do your research beforehand.[2]Use extra caution if shipping overseas. Many countries have specific regulations about what can be sent through the mail. In general, sending perishable food (such as produce, meat, and dairy products) is subject to regulation and are best avoided.[3] Specific country restrictions can be found here: https://pe.usps.com/text/imm/ab_toc.htm\n","Determine your boyfriends needs.\n","A good care package will include some necessities, some treats, and some sentimental reminders of home. Factor in the availability of goods at your boyfriends location. For example, if he is just in another part of the country at college, he probably has access to the same goods as you do, so you may want to focus your care package more on local treats and sentimental items. If he is deployed in a developing country, he will appreciate more necessities than sentimental items.Remember to keep size and weight of all items in mind as you make your purchasing decisions.Consider some special items if your boyfriend is on deployment. You may wish to consult some lists about what items servicemen and women want and need while on deployment. Some items you may want to send include powdered drink mix, individual packets of condiments (such as hot sauce), socks, batteries, or puzzle books.[4]\n","Buy necessities.\n","Buy things you know your boyfriend needs, appreciates, and will use first. You could ask him about products he uses frequently, or items he needs replacing, in order to get ideas about what youd like to include in his care package.You might want to find out about his preferred brands of toiletries or needed clothing items.To save on shipping, you may want to consider buying travel size bottles of toiletries like shampoo, lotion, or shaving cream.\n","Include some treats.\n","You may want to add some lightweight treats he loves in your care package. Consider including his favorite snacks, candy or gum, a paperback book, or magazines.You could ask your boyfriend if there are any treats he is craving from home that he cant get where he is located. Purchase them and include them in your package.You could include some of your favorite treats in the package, too, to make him think of you. Maybe he always teases you about how much you like strawberry gum, for example. You could include a package of it with a funny little note about it.\n","Add some items of sentimental value.\n","Include a picture of you (or the both of you), a postcard from your hometown, a comic that reminds you of him, or even construction paper hearts with I love you written on them. These items can be as personal and unique as your relationship!If he has any children, younger cousins, or nieces and nephews, he may appreciate receiving some drawings, letters, or pictures of them.If he has a pet still at home, you could include a picture of his favorite dog or cat.If you are sending a package for a holiday, you could include some holiday decorations. For example, if you are sending a Christmas care package, you could include a homemade ornament.[5]\n","Make something.\n","If you want to maximize your budget, put your creative skills to good use to make your boyfriend something special. You could make him something useful or something sentimental. It can be as simple or as complicated as you wish, depending on your skill level and available time.If you are handy with fabric, you could make your boyfriend a blanket. A fleece tie blanket doesnt even require a sewing machine.Create a scrapbook signed by all of his friends who miss him while he is away. Have his friends include small mementos, like ticket stubs or photos, in the scrapbook.You could make him a CD of his favorite music.Bake something. Bake a batch of your boyfriends favorite cookies, or another treat that will hold up in shipping. Make sure the food item youre sending adheres to any rules at his residence. (For example, food with nuts might be prohibited at school.)\n","Include a letter.\n","Make sure you include a letter that expresses your feelings about him and lets him know how much he is in your thoughts. He will appreciate knowing how much he means to you.Your letter could include your feelings as well as day-to-day events in your life.You could even include letters from other friends and family in your package, particularly if he is not able to receive mail frequently.\n","Find a box.\n","Get the smallest box you can that will safely ship all the items in your care package. Keep in mind that you may need to specially pack certain items to insure they dont break or leak.You can usually buy boxes at your post office or shipping companys store. Some stores will pack your items for an additional fee. If youll be shipping to him often, it might make sense to keep packaging from any online orders you receive to reuse. You can ask friends and family to save theirs too.\n","Pack it.\n","Make sure that nothing can spill or break inside the box. Secure the contents of the box so that they do not jostle around in transit.If there is anything that is fragile, wrap it carefully with newspaper or bubble wrap. If you are sending a package to your boyfriend in a faraway country, he may appreciate the newspaper wrap to be able to read some of the news from back home!If there is any liquid, put it in a small plastic bag and tape up the ends. That way if it breaks open, the whole package isnt ruined.Separate toiletries and foods. Secure soaps in separate plastic bags to avoid their odor contaminating the food. Put foods in their own, separate plastic bags as well.[6]Stuff newspaper or filler material in the empty spaces in the boxes to prevent contents moving around.Tape the box securely to prevent it from being opened during transit.\n","Make the package look pretty.\n","Decorate the package if you want. Put colorful tissue paper in it. Tie ribbons around the gifts. Draw or write something on the outside of the box that way as soon as he picks up the package, hell know who its from!Keep in mind that additional decorative material may add weight (and therefore, expense) to your shipping cost.Make sure any decorations on the outside of the box dont obscure addresses.\n","Ship your package.\n","There are plenty of shipping companies that will deliver your parcel, as well as the post office. Shipping through your post office will likely be the least expensive, and private shipping companies will be more expensive.You may want to research several companies, as well as your post office, to find out how much it will cost to send a package. For example, you may want to call the company or go online to ask, How much would it cost to send a six pound package from Chicago to Glasgow?You may also have to pay extra if the dimensions of the package are outside acceptable limits.[7]If you want, get insurance on the package. It is usually fairly inexpensive.Fill out a customs form if it is destined for somewhere outside of the country. You will get this form at your post office or at your shipping company. You need to list the contents of the package and the cost of the item on the form.[8]Make sure that the mailing address is correct, and that your return address is visible.If something included is perishable, make sure that that is indicated clearly on the outside of the package.\n","How to Walk in the Spirit: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Face the battle.\n","Even though it may not seem like it as you go about your everyday life, walking in the Spirit requires you to take part in the spiritual battle going on all around you. Wickedness and corruption will always try to lead you astray. You must be aware of these dangers before you can hope to avoid them.Your \"spirit self\" is in constant battle with your \"flesh self.\" Whichever side gains control of your beliefs and actions will gain control of your soul and become victorious.Walking in the Spirit means walking with the Holy Spirit in a manner that allows your own spirit to gain control.\n","Know your enemy.\n","In essence, you'll have to face three different but connected enemies: the devil, the world, and the flesh.Know that the phrase, \"the devil made me do it,\" is somewhat inaccurate. Even though the devil has power and influence in the world, he cannot force someone who is saved and walking in the Spirit to do anything. The devil may tempt you, but giving into that temptation is your own responsibility.The devil's influence is in the world, and as such, the world will often tempt you away from what is good and right.Identify the flesh. The flesh is not your body, even though the two components are connected. The flesh is merely the part of you that desires worldly pleasure and rejects spiritual virtue.Routinely denying your flesh strengthens your spirit. By taming the flesh, you are saying \"no\" to worldly desire and \"yes\" to the God.[1]\n","Familiarize yourself with the battle front.\n","More accurately, familiarize yourself with both battle fronts. You will need to prepare yourself to confront wickedness both internally and externally.The internal battlefield of the mind refers to the way you think and feel about the world around you and the people in it. The external battlefield of behavior refers to the way you act and speak in various situations.These two fronts are connected. If your mind is steeped in wickedness, your actions will eventually follow. If you continually indulge in wicked behavior, your mind will gradually make excuses for that wickedness.\n","Accept yourself for what you are.\n","There are two components of your identity. First, you must recognize yourself as a human, which means acknowledging your own weakness and limitations. Second, you must see yourself for who you are in Christ and understand the strength that comes with that new identity.You are a soul living in a physical body. As such, true well-being refers to the state of your soul more than the state of your body.On your own, you are not safe against sin, vice, and spiritual death.Accepting God and embracing your identity in Christ means understanding that God loves you and is on your side.\n","Identify your own weaknesses honestly.\n","Every person deals with temptation, but no one deals with temptation in the same way. The temptations you feel weakest against may not be the same temptations that your neighbor feels weakest against. Identify your greatest weaknesses so that you can guard yourself against them more effectively.You can be certain that the devil knows your weaknesses and will prey on them as often as possible. The good news, however, is that God also knows your weaknesses and knows how to prepare you to work through them.\n","Lean on your biggest ally, the Holy Spirit.\n","Once you fully understand the battle you are fighting and the danger of being led astray, you need to recognize that your greatest ally in the conflict is the Holy Spirit. Only by walking in the Spirit can you hope to overcome the flesh.The Holy Spirit will give you the strength and endurance to fight the battle and live a virtuous life. You may still slip and stumble, but by relying on the Spirit, your overall spiritual journey will have a positive outcome.\n","Prioritize your spiritual life.\n","If you really want to walk in the Spirit, you need to make a conscious effort to do so each and every day. Your spiritual walk is the most significant aspect of your life. If you ignore it or place other issues before it, you are likely to lose your footing.Put \"first\" things first. Your daily life is made up of various concernsfamily, work, school, and so onand each of these matters have their place. Your spiritual walk comes before all else, though, and you need to recognize that if you want to be sure of your steps.A good way to set your mind on the Spirit is to offer a prayer of renewed faith and dependence each morning when you wake up, preferably before you do anything else.When analyzing any given situation or circumstance, think about it in terms of how it fits in with the Kingdom of Heaven before worrying about how it appears from a worldly perspective. Ask yourself if God would be pleased with something before wondering what others will think.\n","Pray.\n","Ask God for guidance and assistance on your walk. More importantly, pray, then listen. You probably won't hear an actual auditory response, but God often has other ways of telling you what you need to know.Typically, the Spirit will whisper some warning to your heart when you have encountered something wrong or dangerous to your spiritual well-being. Learning to interpret these whisperings can take practice, but with experience, you will likely come to understand them for what they are.Consider what it is like to have a conversation with someone in which the other person does all the talking and never lets you speak. When you pray \"at\" God by merely reciting a wish list of requests, you do not give God the opportunity to speak to you in return. Instead of doing this, you should spend time in contemplation and meditation when you pray.God might talk to you by putting a thought in your mind you would not usually have or by arranging circumstances in a way that stands out. Keep your eyes, mind, and heart open as you go about your daily routine.\n","Examine your conscience.\n","While feeling constant guilt over your sins can drag you down, you do need to examine your conscience on a regular basis and be honest with yourself about your missteps and stumbles. Only by acknowledging these flaws can you hope to overcome and avoid them in the future.Consider the image of a garden. By examining the garden of your spiritual life, you can identify weeds and remove them before they start killing healthy plants and fruits. If you mow everything down carelessly, you will end up destroying good along with the bad. If you do not remove anything, though, the bad can eventually strangle the good.\n","Listen, trust, and obey.\n","Allow God to communicate to you and trust that His will is best. Once you learn to trust God's will, you will naturally find it easier to obey it. In the meantime, you will need to obey God's will and commandments even if doing so goes against your gut instinct or human desires.You need to obey God's lawgeneral rules that apply to all mankindas well as God's instructions for your own life as an individual. God's law is described in the Bible, but you will need to be attentive to how God speaks to you in your own life to decipher personal instructions.Sometimes, the direction the Spirit leads you in will be obvious, but oftentimes, the purpose behind that guidance does not appear to make sense. It is during those moments that trust in the Holy Spirit becomes important. If you believe that God loves you and wants the best for you, it follows that Godwho is all-knowing and all-powerfulwill guide you toward your best possible future.Understand that obeying God means obeying immediately. Delaying your obedience is actually a form of disobedience.\n","Watch your life for fruits of the Spirit.\n","When your life begins to exhibit these fruits of the Spirit, you can reassure yourself that you are walking in the Spirit as you should. These fruits are not responsible for your salvation, but they are typically the natural result of your salvation and of a healthy, consistent walk in the Spirit.The fruits of the Spirit, according to Galatians 5:22-23, are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.[2]Understand that the walk comes first and the fruits follow. Simply mimicking the fruits of the Spirit in your own life will not set you on the right path, mainly because it will be impossible to truly display those fruits in your long-term thinking and actions. First you must follow the Spirit. After that, the fruit will develop naturally.Do not be discouraged if you do not display all of these fruits. Spiritual struggles will likely follow you all your life. The important thing is to let God develop these traits in you in His time.\n","Avoid sources of strife and conflict.\n","When unavoidable conflict comes, you will need to stand firm. That being said, you should maintain a spirit of peace and love as far as your own actions are concerned. Avoid strife for the sake of nurturing your own spiritual walk. You should also avoid spreading conflict for the sake of others.Another way to put it would be, don't go looking for trouble. When trouble finds you, let God guide you through it. Knowing that God will guide you through difficulties is no reason to create them yourself, though.\n","Speak carefully.\n","Words have a greater power than people often realize. The words you choose, how you speak them, and when you speak them can help maintain your walk or quickly throw you off balance.Listen to others before and consider what you hear before you speak.Allow the Holy Spirit to guide your words and the motives behind your speech.Avoid saying anything rash. Do not speak evil of anyone or use your words to harm another. Remember that there is no \"taking back\" what you said. Once you speak, the words continue to hang in the air no matter how you try to make amends later.\n","Control your anger.\n","There are times when you will be righteously angry, and that is fine. Blind fury and rage should be avoided, however, because that sort of anger has a tendency to destroy rather than nurture. Destructive anger will only make your walk more difficult to manage.Be slow to wrath. Do not allow your anger to control you and control the way you deal with others.When you get angry, ask yourself what the cause of your anger is. Righteous anger has spiritual roots and is directed toward sin and injustice. Destructive anger has worldly roots and often turns into grudges held against specific people.\n","3 Ways to Stop Dry Heaving - wikiHow\n","Drink plenty of fluids.\n","One of the main causes of dry heaving is that there are not enough fluids circulating in your body, causing fluid imbalance. Your best course of action, then, is to drink plenty of fluids. Remember the rule: drink at least 8-12 glasses of water every day. Sports drinks with electrolytes are also good for correcting this imbalance.If you cannot tolerate liquids due to the bad taste in your mouth, then rehydrate gradually. Start by taking small sips of water, apple juice or mint tea.[1]Dehydration due to dry heaving causes a lot of problems. With the loss of mucus, your body signals your heart to work harder and your kidneys to work double time. When vital organs are stressed, it can lead to total shutdown, which, in worst case scenarios, can lead to death.\n","Chew small pieces of ginger or cardamom to relieve nausea.\n","Aromatic herbs like ginger and cardamom can reduce nausea and help get your dry heaves under control.[2] Chew on a tiny bit of fresh or dried ginger or a cardamom seed and see if your symptoms subside.\n","Eat something sweet to get your blood sugar up.\n","Low blood sugar (or hypoglycemia) is a signal that your body is missing some nutrients that you need to fully function. This can cause dry heaving and also serve as a warning.  Luckily, it can be quickly remedied by eating a popsicle or some candy.Maintaining your sugar levels not only prevents hypoglycemia and dry heaving, but also helps in keeping you focused. Eating something sweet will bring glucose to your brain and help transport oxygen to your blood so that it can properly circulate to the different parts of your body.\n","Eat bland food, like toast or soda crackers.\n","These dry, light or somewhat tasteless foods decrease palate sensitivity in the tongue. This reduces dry heaving, gets rid of that bad taste in your mouth, and may even prevent the urge from getting worse. These foods should be soft, not spicy, and low in fiber.  A few good bland foods are:[3]Soup, broth, bouillonRice waterCereals (oatmeal, cream of wheat, corn flakes)Pudding and custardEggsTofuToastSoda crackers\n","Keep your mouth closed while eating.\n","When you chew with your mouth open, you let air into your upper GI tract. This can increase your risk of dry heaves. Chew with your mouth closed to keep air intake to a minimum.You can also reduce your air intake while drinking by drinking from a cup instead of using a straw or drinking directly out of a bottle or can.\n","Avoid foods and drinks with high air content.\n","Eating food with a lot of air in it can aggravate dry heaves. Steer clear of carbonated beverages and beer, as well as foods like ice cream, whipped cream, and omelets.\n","Eat small meals often.\n","Eating a large amount at one time may bring about dry heaves or full-on vomiting. Instead of eating 3 full meals a day, split each meal into 2 and make a 6 meal planyou're eating the same amount, just spaced out throughout the day.Do not allow your stomach to be empty. This is correlated to maintaining your blood sugar level, in addition to taking pressure off your gastric sphincter. While an empty stomach is a trigger for dry heaving to occur, hypoglycemia should also be taken seriously as it can cause myriad other problems like lightheadedness and nausea.[4]\n","Reduce your caffeine intake.\n","Caffeine is a powerful and addictive stimulant that our bodies easily react to. Since it is such a powerful chemical, it can cause the gastrointestinal tract to become hyperactive, leading to dry heaves and vomiting when too much is consumed. To avoid this, limit your caffeine intake to 250 milligrams per day.[5]Coffee, tea and chocolates are not the only goods with caffeine content. See the label for the amount of caffeine on each product you consume.\n","Have something cold.\n","Cold foods and drinks decrease the stimulation of the gastrointestinal system. If you choose something with sugar, that's 2 benefits in 1. However, be sure to only consume what you can tolerate. Start out with a small amount and increase it if you can. Good examples are:Cold, decaffeinated sodaIce chips (put in your mouth and let it melt)PopsiclesSherbetA frozen yogurt bar\n","Take antihistamines (Benadryl).\n","These medications are taken to manage allergic symptoms caused by triggers that can also cause vomiting. Taking antihistamines will help in managing the pain that histamines bring about in case you are dehydrated due to dry heaving. 1 or 2 tablets of an antihistamine like Benadryl should help stop the urge to vomit.Histamine is actually an essential chemical messenger in the brain. Also, it manages water intake as well as drought management in the body. It's when these chemicals flare up in allergic reaction that an anti-histamine comes in handy.\n","Consider taking anti-vomiting/nausea drugs.\n","Medications like Bonine and phenothiazines can be taken to settle gastric contents in your stomach and help stop vomiting. These should be taken once daily or as needed whenever symptoms arise. Talk to your doctor about what's appropriate for youthe dosage will depend upon the severity of your condition.Phenothiazines (Compazine and Phenergan) block dopamine receptors that trigger neurotransmitters for involuntary vomiting. Once these neurotransmitters are blocked, retching will likely cease.\n","Talk to your doctor about anti-anxiety medications.\n","Quite clearly, anxiety causes stress. When you are stressed, a horde of symptoms manifests which can lead to dry heaving. Taking Ativan or Xanax as needed or when anxiety attacks manifest may greatly help if you suspect stress may be the cause of your dry heaving.Alprazolam (Xanax) is usually prescribed in a dosage of 0.25 mg thrice a day for short anxiety attacks. However, correct dosing of anti-anxiety medications should be at your psychiatrists discretion. These are downers and need to be taken carefully as they slow and decrease everything from heart rate to organ functioning.\n","Consider alternative measures like acupuncture.\n","Sometimes alternative measures such as acupuncture and acupressure are also considered to be effective against dry heaving, especially for pregnant people. The principle involved here is that when energy is unbalanced, illness will develop. In order to restore balance, certain points need to be stimulated in order to reduce episodes of dry heaving as well as relax the gastrointestinal tract. This is where acupuncture comes in.If you're not fond of needles, consider acupressure or a deep tissue massage. Mention to your masseuse that you're interested in relieving pressure points for the sake of your health.\n","Hydrate before consuming alcohol.\n","Before a night of drinking, try to drink at least 750 mL (3 cups) of water, or however much you can tolerate. Drinking a lot of water before drinking alcohol prevents you from becoming severely dehydrated. With enough water in your system, alcohol gets diluted and its absorption is slowed, therefore delaying the negative effects of overconsumption, like vomiting and dry heaving.After consuming too much alcohol, alcohol replaces the water in your body, making you dehydrated. You end up vomiting until there's nothing left. That's when dry heaving starts. With more water in your system, dry heaves can be avoided.\n","Eat food high in healthy fats.\n","Fats reduce alcohol absorption in your body. This works the same way as taking in more water. It slows the absorption of alcohol to the body, thereby delaying its effects. However, there is a difference between healthy fat and unhealthy fat. Here are some sources of fat that will keep you feeling energized and healthy:Fatty fish, like salmon, mackerel, and herringWalnuts, almonds, and other nutsOlive, grapeseed, and flaxseed oilsAvocados\n","Relax\n",". Anxiety and stress are things we all experience. People who have difficulty coping with stress experience signs and symptoms in the body. This is called conversion, a type of defense mechanism against stress and anxiety. Nausea, vomiting and retching (dry heaving) appear with no clear physical cause. In order to avoid this, stay relaxed!Apart from taking anti-anxiety medications, introduce yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises into your routine. If those aren't up your alley, take a vacation or try a relaxing hobby. Even if it's half an hour of \"me-time,\" it'll help.\n","Avoid triggers like bad smells.\n","An awful and stomach-turning smell can give you the urge to dry heave. Common nauseating odors include smoke, perfume and certain food smells. Try to avoid these if you're feeling especially sensitive to odors, light, and sound.  If you cannot avoid it, wear a mask to cover your nose and mouth or simply use a handkerchief.Odors trigger dry heaves by sending too many chemical stimuli to the brain. Your olfactory system is highly connected to your digestive system, so a bad smell can produce the urge to vomit.\n","Minimize exposure to motion sickness.\n","Plenty of people feel the urge to vomit when they're suffering from motion sickness. This happens when what we see and what our body thinks is our position arent in conjunction. Simply driving down a windy road can cause it, as can being on a boat, roller coaster, or any other up-and-down, left-and-right, jostling experience.Try not to listen to people talking about motion sickness. For some unknown reason, a person who listens to people who say that they have motion sickness may get it too. It's like yawningsometimes it's contagious.To combat motion sickness, look at a fixed object (example: the horizon) while travelling in any vehicle. Fixed views do not stimulate the brain, reducing the urge to heave.\n","4 Simple Ways to Mix Essential Oils with Carrier Oils - wikiHow\n","Read the essential oils bottle to check for mixing instructions.\n","Certain vials of essential oil are pre-mixed, blended, or designed to be mixed in a certain way. Read an essential oils packaging carefully to see if there are any specific instructions regarding the ratio between the essential oil and carrier oil.[2]Consult a medical or aromatherapy professional before you use an essential oil, especially if you have any allergies.[3]Never ingest an essential oil. Never apply an undiluted essential oil to your skin.[4]Make sure that you are not using fragrance oils, which have similar packaging. Unlike essential oils, fragrance oils are synthetic and have no health benefits.\n","Use olive or sweet almond oil for a basic carrier that is fairly odorless.\n","Olive oil and sweet almond oil are simple carrier oils that have little influence on the scent of an essential oil. If you dont have any preferences and want to pair your essential oil with a one-dimensional carrier oil, opt for sweet almond or olive oil.[5]Some essential oil enthusiasts dislike the thickness and texture of some olive oils. If you tend to dislike foods that rely on olive oil, try using sweet almond oil instead.Olive oil has a 2-year shelf life, while sweet almond oil usually wont be good for more than 10 months.Apricot oil is a good alternative to almond oil if you enjoy fruitier scents.[6] It can be a little more expensive, though. Apricot oil has a shelf life of 1 year.If you were storing a carrier oil in the refrigerator to preserve its shelf life, leave it out on your counter for a few hours to let it return to room temperature.\n","Select avocado, jojoba, or primrose oil for skin treatments.\n","Avocado oil is rich in amino acids, which are soothing and good for your skin. This makes avocado oil a good carrier for people with sensitive skin. Jojoba oil is incredibly close to the natural oils on human skin, which makes it a good choice if you want an inoffensive option. Primrose oil is rich in nutrients that keep skin healthy, but it can be quite expensive.[7]Marula, rosehip, and Argan oil are all rich in antioxidants, which make them great for facial treatments. These oils have a shelf life of 2 years, although it is recommended that you use marula oil within 6 months of the bottling date.Avocado oil has a shelf life of 1 year, jojoba oil will last 5 years, while primrose oil will only last for 6-9 months.Fractionated coconut oil, which will last for 2 years, is a good option for skin treatments if you prefer a thinner texture.If you were storing oils in the refrigerator, leave them out on your counter for a few hours to bring them to room temperature before using them.\n","Smell your carrier oil and rub some between your fingers to get a feel for it.\n","If youre trying to look for a certain texture, scent, or consistency in your mixture, test a carrier oil on its own. With your essential oils scent in mind, take a carrier oil and inhale it with the bottle underneath your nose. Put a drop on your finger and rub it between your fingers to test the texture out. If you think it will make a good pairing with an essential oil, try it out![8]Common carrier oils include olive oil, apricot oil, almond oil, coconut oil, and jojoba oil.Any oil that you can ingest or cook with can be used as a carrier oil.While essential oils are not safe to touch, carrier oils are perfectly fine to handle on their own.\n","Use an oil-based lotion or cream if you want to modify a product.\n","Any cream or lotion that contains triglyceridea type of fat found in organic oilscan be used as a carrier. If you want to modify one of your lotions, moisturizers, or hair products, read the products ingredient list to see if it contains triglyceride.[9]\n","Choose a basic 1% dilution if there are no instructions.\n","A mixture that is 1% essential oil and 99% carrier oil is a safe standard if there are no instructions on the essential oils bottle. The largest percentage of an essential oil that you can add to a solution is 2% if youre touching it, so if youre between 1-1.5%, you should be fine unless youre particularly sensitive to a scent or oil.[10]Children younger than 6 years old should never be exposed to a solution that is more than 0.25% essential oil.\n","Use a dilution between 2.5-10% for massage oils if youre an adult.\n","Adults can handle a stronger dose of essential oils for massages. Depending on your reaction to an essential oil, mix a 2.5-10% dilution. Mild oils like rose, chamomile, neroli, and sandalwood all pair well with a carrier oil to make a great massage oil.[11]Coconut oil makes a great carrier oil for massages.Essential oil blends are good for massages if youre experiencing stress, trouble sleeping, or headaches. Find an oil you like and mix it with some coconut oil for a great massage experience!A 2% dilution is really good for massage oils.[12]\n","Mix a 10-20% dilution if you're making a perfume.\n","Perfume oils can have a higher concentration of essential oil than massage oils since they arent being rubbed into the skin and arent covering as much of your body. The higher percentage of an essential oil you use, the stronger the scent will be. Essential oils like sandalwood and lavender are very popular in perfumes.[13]Other common essential oils used in perfume include vanilla and jasmine.\n","Dilute stronger essential oils so that theyre less than 1% of a solution.\n","Essential oils with particularly potent aromas and textures need to be diluted even further if theyre going to be applied to skin. Cinnamon bark, oregano, and clove need to be diluted further than milder oils, like rose or lavender.[14]Stronger oils like clove, oregano, and lemongrass tend to be good for clearing out your respiratory system.Research individual essential oils online if you aren't sure of their potency.\n","Add 30 millilitres (6.1tsp) of your carrier oil to a small bottle.\n","Use a measuring spoon to pour out 30 millilitres (6.1tsp) of your carrier oil. Once you have the proper amount measured out, carefully pour it into a clean bottle. If youre pouring your oils into a bottle with a small mouth, use a funnel to make sure that all of your carrier oil makes it into the container.[15]Do this over a sink or dry towel in case you end up spilling. Oils can be tricky and annoying to clean up.Use an empty dropper bottle to store your mixture if you plan on mixing your solution with something else. The pipette under the cap will make it easier to add your essential oil mixture to an aromatherapy machine or lotion.Make sure that your empty dropper bottle has been thoroughly wiped clean if you were using it for something else beforehand.\n","Add 9 drops of essential oil to the carrier oil with a dropper or pipette.\n","Fill the pipette or dropper with your essential oil by pressing the top to create a vacuum in the pipette. Release the top to suck in your oil. Hold the pipette at a 90-degree angle with the top of your carrier oils bottle. Count off 9 drops as they come out of the pipette, increasing the angle to hasten the flow as necessary.[16]You may need to squeeze lightly to begin dropping the oil, but be ready to pay attention to how much youre adding. It may come out quickly.The average droplet is roughly 0.0250.1 millilitres (0.00510.0203tsp).It can be very hard to measure essential oils using conventional methods unless youre making a lot of a certain mixture, which is usually a bad idea if your carrier oil has a shelf life. Using the drops from a dropper is the best way to estimate how much oil youre adding.\n","Close the cap on your mixture and swirl it around a few times.\n","Close the cap on your mixture. Flick it around in a circular motion to shake up the solution inside and mix the ingredients together. Avoid shaking your bottle in the event that your cap doesnt have an airtight seal. If you are mixing your solution in a bowl or larger bottle, feel free to use a spoon to mix it.Add additional carrier oil if you accidentally add too much essential oil. It is always better to play it safe by diluting an essential oil with more carrier oil if youve accidentally added too much essential oil.\n","Store diluted essential oils in a cool, dark place.\n","Be sure to keep your mixture in an airtight container and out of direct sunlight. Light and heat will accelerate deterioration, so always store your diluted mixtures somewhere cool and dark, like a cabinet or closet. When stored properly, essential oils by themselves can last for years. The carrier you used may shorten the shelf life, however, so keep that in mind.\n","Dont use undiluted essential oils on your skin.\n","If youre planning on using an essential oil on your skin, always dilute it with a carrier oil.[17] Essential oils are potent on their own, especially if they have a particularly assertive scent or reactive element. If you dont dilute the essential oil, you risk damaging your skin or causing yourself pain.[18]Don't worrydiluting an essential oil doesn't reduce its potency or ability for healing.[19]If you come into contact with an undiluted essential oil, you could contract contact dermatitisan itchy rash related to eczema.Essential oils are unregulated, which means that they arent considered safe for ingestion.\n","Test a mixture on your inner forearm before applying it.\n","Carefully drop a small droplet of your mixture on your inner forearm. If you feel any pain or irritation, wipe it off immediately and wash your arm with soap and water. If you dont feel any negative effects after 2 days, the mixture is probably safe to use on your skin.[20]\n","Avoid using essential oils to treat medical conditions.\n","While an essential oil mixture may have therapeutic elements, they are not medicine. You cannot use essential oils to treat physical conditions, and you should always consult a medical professional before using an essential oil for anything other than aromatherapy.[21]Avoid using essential oils if you are pregnant, even if you simply plan on using them for aromatherapy.If you do choose to use essential oils during pregnancy, always consult a licensed aromatherapist first.[22]\n","11 Easy Ways to Make a Sagittarius Man Regret Losing You - wikiHow\n","Nothing gets a Sagittarius mans attention more than a mystery.\n","Tell him youve got some exciting projects going on without going into all the details.

Though not every single Montessori-related job will require a college education, many states in the U.S. (and many countries outside the U.S.) have this as a requirement for Montessori teachers. In addition, the lack of a college degree may, in certain situations, qualify you only to become certified only for assistant-level positions. For these reasons, a college degree can greatly expand the range of Montessori opportunities available to you.[1]Luckily, Montessori teachers-in-training usually aren't required to have majored in education or a related field in college. Many successful Montessori teachers originally studied in fields as diverse as law, engineering, or the humanities.\n","Pick an accredited training center.\n","Montessori certification training is a serious investment  though it will give you valuable skills and credentials, it can cost thousands of dollars and require a year or more to complete. Because of this, it's very, very important to be sure that the training center you enroll at is fully accredited by a recognized Montessori accreditation agency. Most legitimate training centers will be more than happy to disclose their accreditation status with you. If the training center you're thinking of enrolling in lacks the proper credentials, do not enroll  this can be a huge waste of your time and money.[2]Luckily, Association Montessori Internationale (AMI), the global Montessori association, has a directory of certified training centers available on its website. In addition, The Montessori Foundation has a more extensive list of training locations.Additionally, the American Montessori Society offers a free online training center locator.Note that, in the United States, accreditation from the Montessori Accreditation Council for Teacher Education (MACTE) is generally seen as the definitive sign of a training program's legitimacy.[3]\n","Choose an area of certification.\n","Contrary to popular belief, Montessori isn't just a style of teaching for preschool-aged children. In fact, it's a versatile teaching method that's used for children up to (and, in rare instances, through) their teenage years. While the foundational principles of Montessori teaching are the same for all Montessori classrooms, the techniques and skills used to teach different ages of children can vary substantially, so, in general, most people who want to become a Montessori teacher need to specialize in one or more educational age ranges. The most commonly-offered areas of certification are:[4]Infant & Toddler: (0 - 3 years)Early Childhood: (2.5 - 6 years)Elementary I (6 - 9 years)Elementary II (9 - 12 years)Elementary I & II (6 - 12 years)Montessori administrationNote that some special programs offer skills for teaching children up to age 18.\n","Enroll in a training program.\n","When you've located a fully accredited training center near you, you'll want to enroll in the next available training session. The precise start and end dates of your training period will vary based on your training agency  for instance, some courses run year-round, while others take place over one, two, or more summers.[5] Pick a training schedule that accommodates your goals and needs.Montessori training programs vary in price, but, in general, you should expect to spend at least several thousand dollars. For instance, some relatively low-cost Infant/Toddler training programs run at about $2,000 in total.[6]\n","Complete your coursework.\n","Though training programs can vary, in general, people training to become Montessori teachers attend classroom lectures, complete written coursework, and practice hands-on training. The mixture of abstract and practical work offered by most Montessori programs is designed to produce a graduate who is comfortable and experienced working in a Montessori classroom setting and who understands the principles of Montessori teaching well enough to adapt to any situation. In general, Montessori teachers-in-training should expect to: Complete approximately 1,200 hours of instruction in total.Demonstrate an ability to create Montessori teaching materials for all subjects.Participate in approximately 90 hours of classroom observations and supervised teaching.Complete an on-site teaching practicum.\n","Find a Montessori classroom near you.\n","Congratulations! You've completed your Montessori training and you're now fully certified to lead a Montessori classroom. Many Montessori teachers get their first job from connections they make during their on-site training and practicum. However, if you don't, this is OK  except in some cases (like for certifications earned through distance learning), Montessori credentials are transferable, marketable skills. Generally, people who have just received their Montessori credentials will want to apply for jobs at local schools with open positions for teaching children of the age range(s) for which they are certified to teach.[7]While you can simply contact local schools directly to check for job openings, an even easier way to find open positions is to use an online Montessori job finder! For instance, the American Montessori Society's online job search utility allows you to quickly find Montessori openings in your local area.\n","Apply for multiple positions.\n","As you would do when searching for any other job, you'll generally want to apply for multiple positions when you're looking to become a Montessori teacher. In some situations, you may be in competition with other Montessori teachers for the opening, and since you've presumably just become certified, you may have less teaching experience than some of the other candidates, so applying to a range of positions gives you the best possible chance of eventually getting a job.Note that, in the U.S., public schools generally pay their teachers higher salaries than private schools. However, for some teachers, private schools offer a freer, easier teaching environment with none of the bureaucracy of the public school system.\n","Demonstrate your commitment to Montessori values.\n","As with most other jobs, prospective Montessori teachers generally go through an interview/vetting process before being hired. You may be required to provide a resume, proof of your certification, and/or personal references (for these, the teachers with whom you completed your practicum are great choices). As you're being considered for the job, you'll want to show your potential employer that you fully understand the principles of Montessori teaching and that you're able to put them into action in a classroom setting. Below are just a few things you may want to be prepared to talk about:[8]The main principles of Montessori education (see section below)Your plan for organizing your classroom and courseworkUnique teaching materials and opportunities you developed during your practicumInstances when you worked to help a slow-learning child progress during your practicumYour commitment to your students, the public, and your profession (a teacher's three main commitments in the Montessori code of ethics)[9]\n","Be negotiable in terms of your job opportunities.\n","As a first-time teacher, it's a possibility that you won't get your ideal teaching position immediately. This is OK  like any other job, the profession of teaching values experience and seniority. As you teach in positions that may not necessarily be ideal for you, you'll gain valuable skills and experience that, in addition to making you a better teacher, will also make you a more attractive job candidate in the future. Stick with it  when it comes to getting your preferred jobs, more experience is always a good thing.[10]\n","Give your children freedom.\n","Unlike traditional classrooms, Montessori classrooms are largely student-led. In other words, students have a great deal of freedom in choosing when and how they complete their assignments (and, in some cases, even which assignments they complete). This principle is fundamental to the Montessori style of teaching. Children who lead their own educational experience learn independence and are more motivated to learn because of the freedoms they're given.[11]For instance, in Montessori classroom, it's not uncommon for the teacher to act as a \"guide\", rather than an instructor. She guides the children to their hands-on activities (and sits down and helps them if needed), but she allows them to interact freely with their environment. She doesn't force them to sit in rows of desks and complete assignments according to rigid rules.\n","Allow your children to learn by doing.\n","Montessori classrooms are much more hands-on than traditional classrooms. While some Montessori coursework may involve writing, spelling, drawing, and other activities that are done at a desk or table with pencil and paper, Montessori teachers look for opportunities for students to learn by manipulating hands-on objects like blocks, beads, and specially-designed Montessori teaching materials. Montessori educators understand that children (especially young children) don't learn best by sitting and listening to lectures  they learn by teaching themselves and each others as they interact with their environment.[12]For example, while a traditional classroom may teach the concept of addition by rote math drills, Montessori classrooms may use hands-on materials like abacus-style \"grids\" of sliding beads to teach the same concept.\n","Allow free movement in the classroom.\n","In Montessori classrooms, children are largely free to come and go as they please. While there may be some periods of quiet, organized instruction, most of the time, children are allowed to move throughout the classroom from activity to activity. The classroom is designed to be accessible to the children  for instance, in a Montessori preschool classroom, teaching materials will usually be arranged on low, open shelves, and the chairs, tables, and workstations will all be appropriately sized for young children.[13]\n","Give children uninterrupted learning opportunities.\n","While Montessori teachers are always available to offer their help to children who need them, often, they make an effort to step back and monitor the children as they learn, stepping in only as needed. Montessori teachers give their students opportunities to interact with their educational materials and each other with a minimum of interruption for hours at a time. This approach allows children to learn at their own pace without the interference of a rigidly structured schedule, which, for many children, can present unnecessary barriers to learning.For example, in a Montessori classroom, the teacher may instruct her children that, by the end of the day, they need to complete and turn in three specific educational tasks. During the day, the teacher will walk through the classroom, interacting with the children, monitoring their behavior, and offering help to those who need it, but she won't assign specific time deadlines for them to complete their various tasks.\n","Encourage mixed-age interactions.\n","One important hallmark of Montessori education is that classrooms can include children of varying ages. With this approach, the older, more experienced children are encouraged to teach the younger ones, which benefits both students  the young children receive instruction from their peers and the older children demonstrate mastery of the coursework by teaching it themselves. In addition, children taught in a mixed-age environment gradually become more patient and comfortable interacting with others of varying learning abilities.\n","Cancer's Lucky Numbers, Years, Days, Colors, Gems & Letters\n","2 can bring Cancer peace and love.\n","As a sensitive Cancer, you tend to feel others emotions strongly, as well as your own.

The care tag will say either W, S, SW, or X.[1]W: wet/water cleaning only. You can use water or vinegar in your cleaning solution.S: dry solvent cleaning only. Use a dry solvent, like baking soda, or have professionals dry clean your couch.[2]SW: solvent and/or wet cleaning. Use a dry solvent, or vinegar or water.X: professional cleaning or vacuuming only.Reader Poll: We asked 156 wikiHow readers how they prefer to clean polyester, and only 4% of them said a professional upholstery cleaner. [Take Poll] There are lots of simple DIY methods that can effectively clean polyester and other upholstery instead.\n","Wash removable covers in the washing machine.\n","If your couch pillows and cushions have removable covers, youre in luck. As long as your couchs care tag says W or SW, you can just toss the covers in the clothes washer.[3]If your cushions dont have removable covers, vacuum them with a hand-held vacuum, or a brush extension on a regular vacuum cleaner.[4]\n","Spot-clean stains with steam.\n","Check the care tag of the couch to verify if you can steam clean it.

People they are closer to, like relatives and siblings, may be more open to hugging and touching than strangers. Likewise, people from other cultures may prefer more or less personal space.[2]Tell kids how to read body language. Teach them that people tensing up, crossing their arms, and backing away is a sign their personal space is being invaded.You should also let kids know they're entitled to their own personal space. Do not pick them up without their permission, or hug them if they do not want to be hugged. Let them know they have authority over their own bodies.Teach children to do the same in return. Have them ask permission before hugging people, sitting in people's laps, and so on.\n","Teach empathy.\n","Empathy is another important basic of social skills. A young child's perspective is limited. Children may struggle to understand how to put themselves in another person's shoes. Try to make an effort to help kids understand empathy.[3]Encourage kids to use their imagination. Have them picture themselves in a variety of different scenarios. Look for learning opportunities throughout the day. For example, if your child tells you he or she saw someone getting picked on in school, encourage your child to imagine how they would feel in a similar scenario.When watching TV or movies, ask your kids how they think a character is feeling and why. Encourage them to imagine themselves in a similar scenario and think about how they would feel.\n","Help kids understand how to have a conversation.\n","Basic conversation skills are vital to social development. Young children are often unsure of how to converse, and may be prone to interrupting conversations or ignoring what's being said. Talk to your kids about basic conversation skills.Talk to kids about how to enter a conversation. Explain basic greetings. Instruct children to greet others by saying things like, \"Hi!\" and \"How are you?\" Explain non-verbal cues as well, like waving, smiling, nodding, and hand shaking.Explain to children they should take their turns speaking in conversation. Tell them it's important to wait until someone else finishes talking before interjecting. Also, teach kids about listening. Explain that, in a conversation, you should respond to what the other person is saying rather than simply talking about yourself.Teach your children how to be assertive when they talk to people as well. Explain to your child that being assertive is not the same as being aggressive. It means asking for what you want in a direct, honest way.  People who communicate in an assertive way do not use threats, insults, or excuses to get what they want.\n","Teach about basic manners.\n","Children often do not know basic manners, so these are important to teach as well. Explain to kids it's very important to say please, thank you, excuse me, and other forms of common courtesy. Make a rule in your home about remembering pleases and thank-yous. This will show children how to convey positive manners.\n","Talk about expressing wants and needs.\n","Children may often accidentally say insulting things when trying to express wants and needs. For example, your daughter may tell her older brother he's mean if he doesn't give her a turn during a game. What she's trying to communicate is that dislikes feeling left out. Teach children how to appropriately tell others what they want and need.[4]Catch children in the moment. You may hear your son tell your daughter that she's hogging a toy. Interject with something like, \"Mason, what you really mean is that you want Charlotte to give you a turn. Tell her you want to feel included as well.\"Teach children to be upfront with other people about behaviors that make them uncomfortable. A preschool age child may kick and hit when he feels he's being made fun of. Instead, teach him to use his words. Tell him, when he's met with mockery, to say something like, \"It hurts my feeling when you talk like that and I need you to stop.\"Have children stop and think when they're upset. If a child is not sure what he or she wants or needs, ask questions to help that child figure this out. Ask something like, \"Why does that make you angry? Why do you react that way?\"\n","Read to your kids.\n","Reading fiction has been shown to help foster feelings of empathy in both children and adults. Go for high-quality literary children's stories over popular fiction, as characters are often less developed in works designed for a mass audience. Classic children's stories, like The Little Prince and Charlotte's Web, may help children develop empathy. This can help kids learn better social skills throughout life.[5]\n","Model good behavior.\n","A great way to help your kid understand social skills is to simply model good behavior yourself. Be respectful of others during your day-to-day life. If your take your kids grocery shopping, make polite conversation with the cashier. When you pick your child up after school, be kind and courteous to other parents, teachers, and school officials. Children look up to their parents and will pick up on good habits from observing you.[6]\n","Play emotional charades.\n","Emotional charades is a great game designed to teach children to read non-verbal social cues. To play the game, you can write down a variety of emotions on pieces of paper, like happy, sad, scared, etc. Then, place the slips of paper in some kind of container. Take turns drawing slips and acting out the emotions. This can help teach kids to recognize what someone looks like when they're experiencing a certain emotion.[7]You can also play a variation that's like pictionary. Have your kids draw pictures of people or animals conveying a certain emotion and try to guess that emotion.\n","Play games that encourage eye contact.\n","Eye contact is also an important social skill. In western culture, the ability to maintain eye contact shows someone that you're listening and paying attention. Play games that teach kids how to maintain eye contact.[8]Staring contests can be a fun, playful way to teach your kids about eye contact.You can play a game called \"Eyes on the forehead.\" Place a stick of a pair of eyes on your forehead and instruct your kids to keep an eye on the sticker. This won't be eye contact, exactly, but it will give kids a sense of the direction they should look when talking to someone.When playing on a swing, encourage your child to make eye contact with you.Make sure that you teach your child that not all cultures value eye contact and some cultures even consider making eye contact to be rude.\n","Support friendships.\n","Friendships are important to a child's social development. In order to help your child develop social skills, support his or her friendships. Help them blossom and develop.[9]Host playdates. Talk to parents of your children's friends and offer to have the kids over for a day.Take your kids to events where he or she will see friends. School events, birthday parties, and trips to places like the park can be a great way to assure your child sees his or her friends regularly.Help your child deal with rifts with friendships. Explain that it's normal for friends to fight or get angry with one another. Encourage your child to apologize if he or she hurts a friend's feelings.\n","Have your kids play team sports.\n","Research shows important social skills, like leadership and empathy, can be learned through team sports. If your kids are interested in sports, consider enrolling them in a little league team of some kind.In addition to having a positive effect on overall social skills, playing sports encourages physical activity and healthy habits. Kids who engaged in team sports during their youth are less likely to smoke and also may have better self-esteem.Keep in mind, however, that not all kids enjoy sports. If your child is very resistant to sports, don't force it. There are many other extracurricular activities that promote teamwork and togetherness. These can be just as beneficial as team sports to your child.\n","Get your kid involved in extracurriculars.\n","Extracurriculars can be a great way to encourage kids to develop social skills. Encourage your kids to join clubs at school or get involved in local organizations.Cater to your child's interest. If your kids are interested in writing and art, have them take classes at a local art center or sign up for the school paper.Think about clubs like Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts. Many children learn vital skills through such organizations.\n","See a therapist, if necessary.\n","If your child does not seem to be developing socially, this could be indicative of an underlying mental health disorder. If you have concerns about your child's social development, talk a child psychiatrist or therapist. You can ask your child's regular doctor for a referral or find a therapist through your insurance provider.\n","Recognize social delays in children.\n","If your child is not developing socially, this can be a sign that something is different. A variety of conditions, like genetic disabilities or autism, can cause your child to develop at a slower or uneven pace. Seek help from a pediatrician or child psychiatrist if your child seems to have difficulties in the following areas:[10]Between 19 and 24 months, your child may not interact with others. Your child may not smile when looking at you or give reaction. A child may also not engage in play or recognize pictures of familiar objects. These symptoms can indicate that your child may be autistic.With autism, as a child gets older, social development may continue to move slowly or at an uneven pace. A child may not engage in brief conversations, follow simple directions, listen to stories, make friends, initiate conversations, or express physical states. This means, your child may not say things like \"I'm hungry\" or \"I'm hurt.\"\n","Talk to your child's teachers.\n","You should make a point of talking to your child's teachers regularly. Make sure you ask the teacher about your child's social development. You also want to make sure your child is not getting bullied or harassed in school. Bullying can set a child back slightly in social development. Having a healthy relationship with your child's teacher can help you keep your eye out for issues like bullying.\n","5 Ways to Deal With Stress - wikiHow\n","Exercise regularly.\n","Targeted exercise goes a long way toward freeing your body of stress hormones and increasing your endorphin levels - responsible for feelings of happiness. Carve out time during your busy day to exercise to both keep your body healthy and as a natural outlet for your stress. You should notice the difference.[1][2]Try to raise your heartbeat to 120-180 beats per minute for about 30 minutes per day. If you don't have time to do all thirty minutes in one sitting, don't worry; you can break up the exercise time however you need to fit your schedule.Swimming, hiking, and biking have been shown to reduce stress as well. A benefit of swimming and biking is that, opposed to jogging, they create far less joint strain, which makes them perfect for people with joint problems or those wanting to prevent them.\n","Get enough sleep.\n","Give your body the sleep it wants, and your stress levels will take a nosedive. Sleep is a mechanism by which your body recuperates and restores its energy reserves. If you're not getting enough sleep, your body will use stress to keep you active and alert in the absence of stored energy.Most adults need at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Young children and older adults need more, about 9-10 hours of sleep per night.Get into regular sleeping habits. If you can, try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each night and morning. Routinizing your sleep cycle will teach your body when it's supposed to go to be tired, aiding in better sleep and less sleep deprivation.49% of Americans who dont get enough sleep blame stress as the culprit.[3] If you believe that you're stuck in a vicious cycle of sleep deprivation/stress creation, see your doctor for more targeted advice.\n","Eat properly.\n","Your body needs to be healthy, strong, happy and properly fueled to help you tackle and even eliminate stress. Like it or not, stress is a bodily reaction to anything that disturbs its natural state, meaning that your body can have a profound effect on producing and relieving stress.Start decreasing caffeine and alcohol intake. In some cases, alcohol intake increases stress response in humans while being linked to substance dependency, a stressful condition itself.[5] Caffeine is also responsible for raising stress levels, especially at work[6], so try to stick to water as a general rule.Eat a healthy breakfast and healthy snacks during the day. It is better to eat several smaller meals throughout the day than to consume three large meals.[7]For a healthy stress-free diet, consume more complex carbohydrates such as whole-grain breads and pasta, foods high in vitamin A such as oranges, foods high in magnesium like spinach, soybeans or salmon, and black and green tea, which contain antioxidants.\n","Learn to relax.\n","Relaxing your body, by whatever natural means, is a great way to reduce stress. Don't expect your stress to immediately dissipate; it can take time. In most cases, try not to fixate on the stress itself while you're relaxing. Think of something placid and tranquil, or think of nothing in particular. Let your body tell your mind that everything is okay.Listen to calm and soft music. Music really gets you relaxed and happy. Try listening to music with no vocals and pick music with instruments like the flute, piano, or violin. Classical, jazz, or folk tunes generally work well, but if that's not your cup of tea, choose music that puts you in a good place.Take a bath. Add Epsom salts or other fragrant bath salts for a luxurious touch. Indulge in your private time and relax the body.Get a massage. Either having a professional massage or con a loved one into giving you a stress-relieving massage. Use lotions or oils and dim ambient light for the most relaxing atmosphere.Start a diary or journal. You don't have to write in it every day. Writing down what's bothering you, what you've been busy with, and how you feel may help you to expel your negative emotions.\n","Practice yoga and meditation.\n","Although you could technically consider yoga your daily exercise, practicing the deep stretches and slow body movements will help you to clear your mind. Meditating - clearing your mind - while practicing gentle yoga will give double the relaxation effect to ease your stress.Use guided imagery to imagine a place that makes you feel at peace. Imagine somewhere that you feel happy; focus on the details to fully remove your mind from the present.Do yoga alone or in a group setting to help you learn new poses. As you advance in your yoga, you will be able to form complex stretches that force you to focus and take your mind off your stress. Practice deep relaxation by doing progressive muscle relaxation. This is when you work through your body by tensing your muscles, holding the tension for ten seconds, and then releasing it. This will soften and relieve all the muscles in your body.\n","Do things you love.\n","Often when you're stressed, you can look at your schedule and see that you are lacking time for doing your favorite activities. Whether that be drawing, writing, reading, playing sports, or cooking, set aside time on a daily basis to do those things you enjoy.If you have a very busy schedule, set aside at least just ten minutes per day to do what you enjoy. Although ideally you should spend thirty minutes to an hour, allowing just a small break from your hectic schedule will be enough to lower your stress levels.\n","Avoid negative thinking.\n","Acknowledge the positive in your life and begin to re-establish some balance in your emotional register. Avoid focusing on only the bad things that happened during your day, but consider the good as well.Stop and count your blessings. Write down even the simplest things that you have and enjoy: a roof over your head, a bed to sleep on, quality food, warmth, security, good health, friends or family. Acknowledge that not everyone has these things.Say something positive to yourself as soon as you wake up every morning. This will keep your energy and mind focused on positive thinking. Be thankful for each day that you have; you never know which one could be your last!Use positive self-talk. Reinforce your resolve through positive statements such as, \"I can handle this, one step at a time,\" or \"Since I've been successful with this before, there's no reason why I can't do it again.\"Visualize positive things; this does not take long but can help you regain focus. Think about success, read about successful people.  Don't admit defeat before you've been defeated. You don't deserve to beat yourself down so that you can punish yourself.\n","Organize your life.\n","Set goals for what you need to achieve during the day, then write a \"to do list\". Add some breathing room in the middle of the day that will give you time to recharge. Taking control of your time and priorities will significantly decrease the amount of stress you feel.Know your limits. Be realistic about what you can and can't accomplish in a day. It's not helpful if you bite off more than you can chew and then castigate yourself for not getting it done.Prioritize your tasks. Work on finishing the highest priority (most urgent/important) items first. Put low priority items on the bottom of your list.  Try to avoid multi-tasking, as this can decrease focus. Instead, try to focus on important tasks and eliminate distractions.[8]Do your most unpleasant or most difficult task at the beginning of the day when you are fresh, thereby avoiding the stress of last minute preparation. Procrastination feeds stress!Emphasize quality in your work, rather than sheer quantity. Take pride in having done something well as opposed to having done a lot of something.Schedule your day, if possible, so that stressful scenarios don't overlap, reducing the number of stressors you must juggle at any one time. Stagger deadlines for large projects.Review your goals at the end of the day and think about everything you have achieved. This is cathartic and will help you sleep better. Check off the things that you accomplished on the to do list.\n","Identify the things that put you under stress.\n","Make sure you understand why you become stressed so that you can try to avoid these circumstances. Knowledge is powerful, and self-knowledge is especially powerful.If you notice, for example, that you regularly get stressed at a certain time with a certain person, go out of your way to prepare your brain for the upcoming stress. If the person is someone you love and trust, tell them how they make you feel in a non-threatening way. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your misgivings, remind yourself that the occasion is momentary, the feeling will pass, and you'll be in complete control soon.\n","Stop worrying about the things you cannot change.\n","This especially comes with things such as politics, and often applies to other individuals. Learning to accept things as they are is an important coping mechanism, but not as easy as it sounds.Is the problem a real problem youre currently facing, rather than an imaginary what-if? If the problem is an imaginary what-if, how likely is it to happen? Is your concern realistic? Can you do something about the problem or prepare for it, or is it out of your controlAdmitting to yourself that there's nothing you can do about a particular issue will go a long way in helping you adjust. Acknowledge that maybe you feed off of stress, like an adrenaline junkie feeds off adrenaline, but that in your case, it's becoming unmanageable.\n","Take responsibility for making your life what you want it to be.\n","It is less stressful to make decisions and take action than to feel powerless and react to others' decisions. Decide what you want and go for it!Learn to say no on occasion. You cannot do everything you are asked, and even if you could, you probably wouldn't want to.Resist the urge to be perfect at all times. Perfectionism can cause huge amounts of stress if you hold yourself to unattainable standards. Be realistic about what you can and can't do. Don't set yourself up for failure just because you want to stroke your ego.Don't get down on yourself for failing if you tried your hardest. You gave it your all, and nobody would ask you for more. Hold yourself accountable, but don't make being accountable impossible.Be one of your own best friends. It may sound cheesy, like something out of a Leave it to Beaver commercial, but it's true: Love yourself, depend (mostly) on yourself, and celebrate the things you do well. Loving yourself will ease the anxious question \"Am I good enough?\" and replace it with \"I know I'm good enough.\"\n","Develop a sense of humor.\n","One of the barriers to stress reduction is the temptation to take things too seriously. It's okay to back off from your intensity and see the humour in life's situations. Laugh a little or better yet, laugh a lot! See the humour in stress.Learn to laugh at yourself. Don't put yourself down, or lash your self-esteem, but try to be playfully deprecating about yourself from time to time. How are you expected to laugh at other things if you can't even laugh at yourself?Help yourself learn to laugh by listening to some stand-up comedy throughout the day. This will help you cultivate humor and keep the tone of your day light.\n","Learn to lean on friends and loved ones.\n","This is one of the most important things, as keeping things bottled up can only cause more stress. Your friends, if they are true friends, will try to understand what you're going through, and will accompany that empathy with a sincere desire to help out if at all possible.Ask your friends for help. If you want something done but can't find the strength or the time to do it, it's okay to ask your friends or loved ones for help. Express your gratitude and extend the offer of help as a kind of reciprocity. Learn to delegate to help decrease stress.Look for people's respect, not approval  your friends included. Your friends will respect you because they love you, even if they don't always agree with you. Your enemies (if you have any) will respect you because your motivations come from a sincere, heartfelt place. Resist the urge to be loved and accepted by everyone; it's literally a Herculean task. You'll find yourself a lot less stressed and a lot more satisfied if you do.Seek out positive people rather than negative ones. It sounds like a truism because it is: Surrounding yourself with people who are fun-loving, excited, and kind will help you avoid the stress you'd be feeling with pessimistic, cynical, mean people.\n","Have more positive self talk.\n","Nothing else helps intensify stress more than negative thoughts. When you start to having the feeling of defeat is the perfect time for a little reminder.You know yourself better than anyone else, and you are the perfect person to give you the reminder that it will get better.Remind yourself of all of the things you have accomplished in the past.  All of those small accomplishments add up to very big ones over time.Change the words you use.  Instead of saying, \"I can't do this,\" say something like, \"I've been able to get through this before, and I will get through it this time too.\"\n","Be honest about your mental situation.\n","If someone is threatening you and you have stress and anxiety, stand up to them and tell them how you feel. Be wary of bullying behaviors, which can both create stress and have long-term negative mental health effects. If the person causing you stress doesn't listen when you open yourself up, be sure to reach out to someone for help.[9]\n","Talk to someone you trust about your stress.\n","If you find yourself with ongoing stress, tell someone you trust about everything that is bothering you. Revealing yourself is a good way to express how you are feeling and get feedback regarding how to best deal with the situation.\n","Get a stress relief ball or punching bag.\n","Try to use this stress-reliving tool every day. That can help you physically express your stress and then relax your body. Holding in emotions is not good for your body.\n","How to Perform the Tahajjud Prayer: 13 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Arrange to wake up after midnight.\n","After praying the Isha prayer and before going to sleep, make arrangements to wake up during the night before the Fajr prayer (for instance, you may want to set an alarm clock or have a family member agree to wake you). Though the Tahajjud can be prayed at any part of the night, if possible, it is best to pray it after midnight, especially during the last third of the night. This is because Allah descends to the lowest heaven during the last third of the night, asking, \"Who is asking me, so I can give to him? Who is calling upon me, so I can answer him? Who is seeking my forgiveness, so I can forgive him?'\" [1]If you make an honest effort to wake up and perform the Tahajjud but accidentally sleep through the night, don't feel guilty. According to a hadeeth, Allah records your genuine intention to perform the Tahajjud and grants you sleep as an act of mercy. You will be rewarded as if your intention had been fulfilled. However, if you make a conscious decision to abandon your intention to pray Tahajjud without good reason, for example through laziness, then it may not be overlooked and a sin may be recorded. [2]\n","Wake up and perform Wudu.\n","Wake up during the night at the time you've chosen. Once you wake, perform Wudu, the ritual ablution Muslims use to cleanse themselves before they pray or handle the Holy Quran. Traditionally, performing Wudu means using clean water to wash oneself in the following four ways:Washing the faceWashing the arms and hands up to and including the elbowsWiping the head (Masah)Washing the feet up to the anklesNote that many Muslims (including the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) also choose to wash their mouth and teeth with a miswak before the Tahajjud.[3]If you have discharged mani earlier in the night, whether during sexual intercourse, a wet dream, or haram means, then the Ghusl full-body ritual cleansing must be performed.It is highly recommended to pray two rakats immediately after completing wudu. This will help you enter the right frame of mind for the upcoming prayer.\n","Go somewhere clean, quiet, and dignified to conduct your prayer.\n","This is done because Allah's names are pure, so, whenever possible, Muslims are encouraged to speak of Him in clean, holy places as a form of reverence. Put on your normal prayer clothes (for example a prayer khimar for women), lay down your prayer mat facing the Holy Kabah in Mecca as you would for your obligatory prayers.To be clear, you don't need to be anywhere special, like a mosque or a lavishly-decorated room in your house, to pray the Tahajjud. All that's needed is a spot that's clean, which can even be in your bedroom.\n","Remove all worldly worries from your heart.\n","At the time of prayer, calmly focus and reflect on the glory of Allah. Do not worry about fleeting worldly problems that are ultimately meaningless in comparison to the infinite wisdom and mercy of Allah. Calm yourself and ignore any negative or distracting thoughts or feelings. Close your eyes and focus your attention on your heart as you begin to achieve a heightened state of spiritual awareness and a feeling of closeness to Allah.Be aware that Allah does not actually need your Tahajjud. Rather, He has prescribed Tahajjud because it is good for Muslims. Thus, it is a gift that all should embrace and be grateful for.\n","Make your intention (niyyah) to pray.\n","As you start your prayer, make a definitive mental declaration to yourself that you are about to perform the Tahajjud. Decide that you are going to complete the Tahajjud in the specific way you have chosen, including how many rakats you will recite. Also decide why you are saying the Tahajjud  for instance, to glorify Allah, praise Allah, thank Allah or ask for His forgiveness for any sins you have committed. You shouldn't make this declaration out loud  Allah knows your thoughts, so your intentions will be clear to him as long as they are clear to you.For example, say in your heart \"I will to perform 8 rakats Tahajjud to seek the forgiveness of Allah\".The Tahajjud is performed by repeating pairs of rakats (cycles) of Salah, the ritual that Muslims use for their obligatory daily prayer. You must stick with your intended number of rakats.\n","Perform two rakats.\n","To begin your Tahajjud, start by performing two quick rakats (cycles) of Salah. Salah begins by standing and reciting verses from the Holy Quran. Then, the person praying continues by bowing low with his hands on his knees, then  prostrating on the ground with his forehead, nose, and palms on the floor and his elbows raised, sitting on his knees with his feet folded under him, and finally standing and reciting \"Allahu Akbar.\" This description of Salah is a generalization  if you're not sure how to perform Salah properly, learn this fundamental Muslim skill before attempting the Tahajjud.Emulate the practices of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) who used to recite the following surahs during each rakat in Tahajjud:[4]After reciting the Al-Fatihah the first rakat, recite the surah \"Al-Kafirun\".After reciting the Al-Fatihah for the second rakat, recite the surah \"Al-Ikhlas\".\n","Perform more rakats in pairs according to your niyyah.\n","Generally, two rakats is seen as the minimum necessary for a proper Tahajjud. However, it's possible to repeat many more if you wish. For instance, according to the Hadiths, the Prophet Muhammad frequently prayed up to thirteen rakats including Witr.[5] Tahajjud is always performed in pairs of rakats and eight is seen as a good number by many Muslims. Most people will say two, four, six, eight or twelve rakats, though more is not discouraged and the more you pray the more rewards are available.If you are able to, then long recitations from surahs such as Al-Baqarah, An-Nis or Al-Imran are highly commended in the subsequent rakats, even if you can manage them only from time to time. One of the benefits of praying at night is that there is no time pressure.Following in the example of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), if you notice dawn approaching while you say your Tahajjud, you may end by performing one rakat as Witr (an optional pre-dawn prayer said before the required Fajr).[6]\n","Add your own prayers (dua) after you've completed the number of rakats you set out to pray.\n","Make sure that they are sincere, respectful, and done in complete devotion to Allah. These may be offered in extended prostration in your own words and language. You may want to offer additional thanks and praise to Allah, pray for strength and guidance, or make a special request for help. For instance, you may ask for blessings for a friend who is suffering through difficult times or help to strengthen your faith or simply spend a few moments thanking Allah for a blessing that He granted you the previous day. Prayers should be offered with humbleness, fear, hope, and patience. This is an ideal time to ask for forgiveness for your mistakes and sins as Allah is especially open to our repentance at night according to many hadeeth.Acknowledge each of your wrongdoings, however big or small - you may feel that some are insignificant, but Allah surely will have seen them and will await your repentance. Ask Allah for forgiveness, sincerely promise not to repeat your sins and make a commitment to obey Allah in the future.Study the verses of the Qur'an describing the Hellfire and use the fear of incurring Allah's punishment to drive yourself to become a better Muslim.Never lose hope of Allah's mercy for the Qur'an tells us more than 70 times that Allah is the Most Forgiving.Any prayer you offer will be heard, and, if Allah wills, your prayer will be answered in kind.Making dua after Tahajjud should not be hurried. It is the time when Allah is in His lowest heaven, so many Muslims take the opportunity to make extended dua perhaps for 30 minutes or more if they are able to.\n","Go back to bed if you become too tired to complete the Tahajjud.\n","Because the Tahajjud interrupts your normal sleep, it's not unlikely that you may be somewhat tired when you first attempt the prayer. If, however, you're so tired that you find yourself forgetting what you're saying as you recite your prayers or you doze off in the middle of your Tahajjud, don't attempt to complete the prayer. In this case, according to several ahadith, Allah notes your sincere willingness to complete the Tahajjud. You may go back to sleep without any need to be embarrassed or ashamed, but try to better prepare yourself next time, perhaps by going to bed earlier.\n","Read scriptural passages about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)'s observance of the Tahajjud.\n","To gain a greater understanding of the unique importance of the Tahajjud prayer, consult any of the numerous references to the prayer in Islamic scripture. Most notably, the Tahajjud is mentioned in the Quran and discussed at great length in numerous ahadith. However, it is also discussed in the work of Islamic scholars throughout the history of the religion.To start, try reading Book 21 (Prayer at Night) from Sahih Bukhari. No less than 70 a hadeeth in this book describe the habits of the Prophet (pbuh) regarding the Tahajjud, which gives a clear indication of its significance in the life of a good Muslim.[7] Commentary on the Tahajjud is also offered at multiple points in the Quran, including Surat 17:79 and Surat 39:9.\n","Consider saying the Tahajjud with your family.\n","Muslim families are encouraged to pray the Tahajjud in communion with each other because both Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and his wife Aisha recommended that husbands and wives should say the Tahajjud together.[8] Performing the Tahajjud as a family allows you to come closer to each other in devotion to Allah and to show solidarity in your worship.If you're interested in trying this, ask your spouse and children to join you before the first night you plan to say the Tahajjud together, then, if they need your help to do so, wake them up and celebrate Allah's infinite greatness and mercy in quiet prayer together. Children over the age of ten should be encouraged to develop the habit of praying Tahajjud when they are ready, but if it is too difficult for them to wake in the night then no blame should be apportioned and they should not be admonished, as long as they are up for Fajr and complete all their obligatory prayers correctly.Encourage your children by teaching them about the rewards available for completing voluntary acts of worship like Tahajjud. When they get older remind them of the consequences in this life and the next of not continually striving to improve their worship.Generally, families that pray the Tahajjud together make exceptions for members that need their sleep, like small children, the sick, and the elderly.\n","Emulate the practices of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).\n","All Muslims are encouraged to live in emulation of the life of Muhammad (pbuh), Allah's Messenger and the Seal of the Prophets. If you're looking for guidance in performing the Tahajjud, study the ways Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) performed the Tahajjud and try to work these habits into your daily life. By striving to emulate the Prophet (pbuh)'s Tahajjud practices, Muslims can work towards the perfect ideal represented by him and, in doing so, become closer to Allah.As noted above, Book 21 from Sahih Bukhari is a great place to start if you're looking for information on Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)'s Tahajjud habits and practices.\n","Make the Tahajjud part of your routine.\n","As an optional prayer, the Tahajjud isn't something that any Muslim should feel compelled to do and there is no Shariah punishment for missing it. However, many Muslims choose to practice the Tahajjud on a regular basis (if not every night) when they are able. Like all forms of prayer, saying the Tahajjud brings you closer to Allah and brings comfort to the heart of  the Muslim. In addition, the Tahajjud is often associated with Allah's gift of mercy, making it a great opportunity to seek forgiveness for minor failures, sins and imperfect actions.Remember that Allah appreciates regular acts of worship, so if you start praying Tahajjud, resolve not to give it up. If you intend to make the Tahajjud a regular part of your life, set a recurring alarm to wake you up during the night and set aside a space in your house for performing it.If you are unable at this stage to commit to praying Tahajjud every single night, then try build up slowly by establishing the habit of saying just two or four rakats two or three times a week, whatever you can manage, with the aim of building up over time. Allah loves it when His servants strive to develop their worship.Once you establish Tahajjud as part of your daily routine, look for ways of enhancing it, for example by praying thirteen rakats including one of Witr, and follow the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) by reciting extended passages from the Qur'an.Remember that Allah never tires of giving rewards as long as His servant does not tire of doing good deeds.\n","How to Replace a Door Trim: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Cut through the caulking with a utility knife.\n","Work your knifes blade under the outside edge of the trim. You may also cut through some paint while doing this, but thats okay. Cut all the way around the trim to free it.[2]Make sure to cut all the way through the caulking to avoid damaging the paint when you pry off the trim.\n","Use a pry bar to pull off the trim.\n","Slide the edge of the pry bar under the trim near a nail. You can tap a hammer against the back of the bar to help wedge it in. Pull back one piece of trim at a time, taking care not to damage the walls and door jamb. It doesnt matter which side you start on, as long as you remove all the pieces you want to replace.[3]To protect the walls, hold a scrap of wood against the wall and rest the back of the pry bar against it as you work. Theres not really a way to protect the jamb besides being very careful when leveraging the trim.\n","Scrape off any remaining caulking with a knife.\n","Use the utility knife or a chisel to remove any old caulk left over. You may also need to scrape down thick layers of paint to level out the space where the new trim will rest.[4]\n","Measure the new trim against the door.\n","First, purchase some trim from the home improvement store. Most trim comes in 8 or 10ft (2.4 or 3.0m) sections. Use your old trim as a sizing guide or hold the new trim against the door frame.[5] Mark the measurements with a pencil so you know how to size the trim.[6]You can always measure out the space around the door with a tape measure if the other options arent possible. Measure out the length and width of the trim space on all sides of the door to find out how much trim you need.Narrower trim can be a good choice for simplicity and appearance, but make sure you leave enough material to cover the gap between the door frame and wall.Wider trim stands out more, but itll cover more of the wall. Make sure you have enough space for it.\n","Put on ear and eye protection before sawing.\n","Cover your eyes with a pair of polycarbonate safety glasses. Miter saws are loud, so also put on a pair of earmuffs or foam earplugs. Avoid putting on gloves or any other loose clothing that could get caught in the saw.[7]\n","Cut the trim pieces with a miter saw.\n","Set the miter saw to cut at an angle of exactly 45. Line up the trim and cut from the inside edge diagonally upwards to the outside edge. Cut a large piece of trim into the top piece and one of the sides.[8]Its okay to leave the trim a little long at first. You can adjust this as needed later.Its helpful to practice using the miter saw on scrap wood first. You are usually able to adjust the saw more than you expect to get a better-fitting joint.\n","Cut the side trim to length.\n","Line up the side pieces of trim against the door. If the trim is long, measure up from the bottom to mark how much length needs to be removed. Cut the bottoms of the side trim pieces evenly so they match and fit on the door frame.[9]\n","Cut the top trim to the appropriate size.\n","Hold the header against the 2 side pieces. This piece has miter joints on both sides, which should fit snugly against the rest of the trim. If you have to reduce the header, make sure the miter is set at a 45 angle. Redo the cut until the header fits in place.\n","Position the trim against the wall.\n","Place the pieces without attaching them to double-check the fit. Pay attention to how the header piece fits on top of the side pieces. Make any adjustments needed by further cutting down the size of the trim.[10]\n","Nail the side trim in place.\n","Use a finish nailer to secure the trim. On the inside part, which covers the door jamb, use 4d or 1.5in (3.8cm) finishing nails. On the outside part, which attaches to the wall, use 6d or 2in (5.1cm) finishing nails to secure the trim.[11]Avoid placing the nails close to the ends of the trim.Depending on the thickness of your trim, you may need larger nails. Hold the nails up to the trim to see if they're long enough to go all the way through to the wall.\n","Drill and nail the header in place.\n","Stand on a stepstool to reach the top part of the door. Place the top trim, checking one last time to make sure its the right size. When finished, attach it the same way you did the other pieces.[12]\n","Pre-drill holes in the trims corners.\n","Push the trim pieces together to tighten them a little more. Measure about 1in (2.5cm) from the sides of the header. Drill a in (1.6mm) hole down through the top of the header. Measure down the side pieces and drill a hole through each from the outside edge.[13]Hold a piece of cardboard against the wall to prevent your tools from damaging it.\n","Nail the trim pieces in place.\n","Stick 3d or 1.25in (3.2cm) nails in each hole. Start on one side of the door. Alternate striking the top and side nails so that the trim doesnt fall out of alignment. When finished, move on to the other side.[14]\n","Caulk the holes, joints, and edges of the trim.\n","The holes and miter joints can be filled with painters putty, wood filler, or a paintable acrylic or silicone caulk as needed. Spread it using a putty knife or your fingers. Then go around the outside of the trim, squeezing a small bead of caulk between the trim and the wall. Run your finger along the bead of caulk to smooth it out, then wipe it clean on a wet rag.[15]Youll need to let the caulk dry before painting or staining. Check the label information to find out how long this takes.\n","Sand, prime, and paint the door frame.\n","[16] Sand the door frame lightly to make it smooth and even. You can further customize your trim by staining or painting it. The trim can be colored with primer and a layer of paint. You can also retain the appearance of wood trim by using a commercial staining product to color it.[17]Use an oil or latex-based primer before painting over wood.\n","How to Balance a Motorcycle Tire: 13 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Take the wheel off the motorcycle.\n","Hold the motorcycle still by engaging the centerstand. Loosen the wheel's lug nuts by turning them counterclockwise with a wrench. Set the lug nuts aside and pull the wheel off the motorcycle.[1]The centerstand is underneath the center part of the motorcycle. Read the owners manual for more specific instructions on how to engage it.\n","Set a static balancer on a flat surface.\n","Static balancers can be purchased online or at tire and motorcycle shops for about $100 USD. Set the machine on the ground or on a table. Pick a spot that seems completely even and stable.[2]Dynamic balancers are also available. These devices test your wheel electronically. Theyre more expensive and often used in tire and repair shops.\n","Test the balancer with a level.\n","Use any sort of level from a home improvement store to test the balancers evenness. Place the level on top of the balancer, fastening it to the bar with masking tape if it doesnt stay put. If the balancer isnt level, move it to different spots until you find even ground.[3]A magnetic level is your best option because it sticks to the balancers bar.\n","Slide the wheel onto the balancer.\n","The metal rod on top of the balancer consists of 2 cones pointing inwards. Pull 1 of the cones to the side and off of the rod. Then, slide the wheel onto the rod, pushing the axle sleeve onto the cone.\n","Put the other balancer cone back in place.\n","Slide the cone back onto the balancers rod. Push it forward until it fits tightly inside the axle sleeve. The wheel should be centered on the rod and set firmly between the cones.As long as the cones are wedged into the wheels axle holes, the tire will stay in place when you spin it later.\n","Degrease the rim with a contact cleaner.\n","Pick up a bottle of WD-40 or another cleaner from a home improvement, automotive, or general store. Dampen a clean cloth in the solution and use it to wipe off the rim. Remove any debris that could affect the balancing test. Always clean the wheel, since debris can skew the balance test results.[4]Although you can clean the wheel at any time, its easier after placing it on the balancer. You can easily reach all sides and the wheel wont collect extra debris before the test.Debris also includes old wheel weights. Always pull off any old weights before attempting to balance the wheel.You can also use nail polish remover to treat stubborn debris, including adhesive residue from old weights.\n","Gently spin the tire and wait for it to stop.\n","Give the wheel a spin so it turns 2 or 3 times. If you use too much force, touch the tire with your finger to slow it down. When it comes to a complete stop, the heaviest part of the wheel will be at the bottom.[5]\n","Mark the lowest part of the wheel with tape.\n","Peel off a small piece of masking tape. Position it on the bottom part of the rim, right in the center. Fasten it in place to mark the wheels lowest point.You may also mark this point with chalk. Mark this low point by drawing a small line on the tire.\n","Tape a wheel weight to the rim's top end.\n","Purchase some adhesive wheel weights from a tire shop. The wheels highest point, opposite the point you marked earlier, is the lightest part of the wheel. Place the weight directly on the rim. Instead of peeling off the backing, secure the weight with a piece of masking tape.[6]Wheel weights generally come in 5g (0.18oz) and 10g (0.35oz) sizes.Non-adhesive wheel weights wrap around the spokes and screw shut. These are less liable to come loose, but they are more expensive.\n","Rotate the wheel to spin it again.\n","Slowly spin the wheel until the taped side and weighted side are on the right and left. Then let go of the wheel and wait for it to come to a stop. The heaviest side will once again come to the bottom.\n","Add and remove weights to balance the wheel.\n","Add weights to the lightest part of the wheel, which is always at the top. If the part with the weight is on top again, that means its still too light. If the weight ends up at the bottom, that means its too heavy and you need to remove weight from that end.[7]Clean the wheel as necessary to remove any adhesive debris.\n","Stop adding weight when the wheel no longer rotates on its own.\n","Test the wheel by rotating it until the heavy and light sides are on the right and left again. When the wheel is balanced, the tire will not move. The heavy side wont fall back to the bottom. Give the wheel a few extra tests to make sure it is balanced.Test the wheel by moving the taped end to different points and letting go of the wheel. Also spin the wheel gently so it turns 2 or 3 times. The heavier side should not fall back to the bottom.\n","Secure the weights in place before replacing the wheel.\n","Bring the weighted end back to the bottom. Remove the adhesive backing on the weights, then press them onto the rim. They fit on the inside part of the rim, right beside the spokes. Move the wheel back onto your motorcycle and enjoy the ride![8]If you use the more expensive screw-on weights, you should have already attached them to the tire. Wrap them around the spokes, then slide the screws into the slots on their backs to hold them in place.\n","How to Write Highlights for a Paper\n","Include the most important part of your research in your highlights.\n","Your highlights are the first thing about your paper that anyone online will read. Use the highlights to tell that potential reader what's so great about your paper and why they want to read it.[2]Conversely, good highlights also keep a potential reader from wasting their time. If your paper doesn't cover information that they need to know or are interested in, highlights let them know immediately so they don't have to read through half your paper before they find that out.\n","Use active voice to keep your writing concise.\n","Take important thoughts from your research paper and reframe them so the sentences are in subject-verb-object order. Use active verbs, such as \"show\" and \"affect\" to describe what your study found.For example, you would write \"UV rays affect skin's overall health\" rather than \"skin's overall health is affected by sun exposure.\"Research papers often use passive voice, which is more wordy and difficult to understand. Because highlights have a strict length requirement, using active voice allows you to stay within the character limits while including the most important information from your article. For example, you might write: \"Prolonged exposure to light damages skin cells.\"\n","Revise for a general audience rather than your peers.\n","When you're writing highlights, your audience is the world at large  not other researchers in your field. Eliminate jargon, acronyms, and other terms of art from your highlights. They should explain your paper the way you would explain it to a child.[3]Use the simplest words possible, even if they aren't technically accurate. For example, instead of referring to \"squamous cells,\" you could say \"skin cells\" or simply \"skin.\" Your paper will get into the specific cells studied.\n","Proofread highlights carefully.\n","Because highlights are so short, a typo will stick out like a sore thumb. Typos in your highlights can also mean you don't show up in as many search results as you should, which defeats the purpose of highlights.One method of proofreading is to read your highlights backward, moving word by word. This encourages you to focus on each individual word rather than the phrase as a whole.It's also a good idea to let someone else give your highlights a read-through. Someone completely unfamiliar with your highlights or your paper might notice errors you've repeatedly overlooked because you know what you meant to say.\n","Ask the publisher what type of document to use for your highlights.\n","Publishers need your highlights in a format they can easily put online. Often, they'll ask for highlights using the same type of document you used to submit your manuscript, although this isn't always the case.[4]For example, the National Science Foundation wants each highlight on an individual Microsoft PowerPoint slide.Highlights were introduced by the publisher Elsevier and many journals and publishers use similar procedures. If the journal or publisher tells you to use Elsevier's requirements, you can get those at https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/highlights.\n","Check the length requirements.\n","Because highlights are used for search engines, the length requirements are specific and typically can't be adjusted. Length requirements are usually given in characters, which include spaces and punctuation. The most common length is a maximum of 85 characters.If you're providing your highlights in bullet points, the bullet point itself typically isn't considered a character. However, all other spaces and punctuation are.Some journals or publishers may also have a minimum length. Even if a specific minimum length isn't given, having a highlight that's only 2 or 3 words typically doesn't provide enough information to a potential reader to be helpful.\n","Complete any required forms to grant permission to use highlights.\n","Some publishers and organizations have copyright or other release forms that you're expected to sign and send in along with your highlights. Your contact at the publisher, usually your editor, will provide you with any forms you need.[5]Double-check to make sure you've met all the publisher's requirements before you submit your highlights. Violations of the publisher's protocol could delay the publication of your paper.\n","How to Effectively Use Internet Time (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Create an Internet activity log.\n","If you find yourself wondering Where does all the time go?, this is a great way to find out. For one week, write down everything you do while using the Internet. What websites you visit, how much time you spend on each, how often you refresh or update pages, each time you click on an embedded link, etc. Often our worst Internet time-wasting habits are things we do mindlessly.[1]Make sure you include the time you spend using the network on your smart phone or other hand-held device. For people with on-the-go lifestyles, this is often where we clock in most of our Internet hours!\n","Identify your problem areas.\n","Checking our email or refreshing our Twitter feed every five minutes is an impulse that keeps us from being able to focus on longer tasks. If the paper were researching begins to feel frustrating or boring, it seems harmless to take a 10-second break in order to see if something more exciting is going on in another window. The problem, though, is that all these little breaks, plus the time it takes us to refocus our attention as it shifts back and forth, really add up. Particular habits will vary from person to person, but some examples might include:Do you check your email fifty times in a day?Perhaps you spend an appalling amount of time on celebrity gossip blogs or websites?Maybe you keep yourself logged in to Google Chat or Facebook Messenger when youre doing other things, and find you are frequently interrupted by friends looking to chat?Or maybe you find that after thirty minutes of concentrating hard on something, you get a sudden intense craving to see if anyone new has liked your new Facebook profile picture, and then just get sucked into your newsfeed for an hour or more?\n","Get acquainted with your dopamine.\n","It might seem like your friend is being hyperbolic when she says something like Im totally addicted to my iPhone!, but theres actual science behind this. Technology dependence actually changes the way our brains work, very similar to the changes a brain undergoes in the instance of drug, alcohol, or gambling addictions.The culprit is a chemical in our brain called dopamine, which controls our moods, motivation, and sense of reward.Every time you hear the bloop of your Facebook messenger, a little surge of dopamine is released in your brain, which is what triggers the urge to check it.Dopamine addiction is an endless cycle. The brief high is caused by the anticipation, the uncertainty of the unknown. Who could the message be from? Usually the urge to find out is greater than the satisfaction we feel once weve actually seen the message, which leaves us feeling a little low, and eager for another dopamine boost.While technology dependence is becoming increasingly common in todays world, we dont have to be slaves to our dopamine receptors. With a little mindfulness and dedication, we can train ourselves to resist this eternally unsatisfying, unproductive loop.\n","Resolve to make necessary changes.\n","For many people, unlearning pre-existing habits can be difficult, especially at first.Recognize that most of these changes are going to require restricting yourself things that bring you comfort or pleasure.Its not uncommon to even experience mild withdrawal symptoms when we begin to alter our Internet behaviors in this way, due to the decrease in dopamine production.Keep in mind that this transitional discomfort is temporary, and that you are on your way to being a happier, healthier, and more productive person. [2]\n","Organize your workstation.\n","Its amazing how much space we free up in our brains just by having a workspace free of visual distractions. If theres a pile of papers begging to be organized, or dirty dishes scattered around, its going to be more difficult to focus on the task at hand. Try to keep your desk (or other work area) free of everything but current projects and whatever items you use every day.\n","Organize your computer desktop.\n","Make sure to keep your files organized into folders, rather that splattered all over your screen, and bookmark websites you use frequently. This will save you a lot of time when it comes to searching for things you need, and will keep you from being distracted by something that catches your eye in the searching process.\n","Make a list of what you need to do on the Internet before you open your browser.\n","Is there a song youve been meaning to listen to? Do you need to read some restaurant reviews to figure out where to bring your mom for her birthday? Do you need to need to research costs for a home-improvement project?This is something you should be doing throughout the day, every day, as things pop into your head.Keeping an Internet to-do list will give you a clearer sense of purpose, and remind you of your long-term time-management goals.\n","Determine what time of day you are most productive.\n","Some people are most alert first thing in the morning, others dont reach their peak until the middle of the night. If you have some flexibility in your daily schedule, try to plan your Internet time for when you are most likely to be awake, energized, and thinking clearly.\n","Plan to do more with less.\n","Internet efficacy is going to mean something different to everyone, depending on career, interests, and other lifestyle factors. Some people need to be logged on all day long for their jobs, while others primarily use the Internet in the evenings as a way to unwind.While the specific time-management goals will vary from person to person, everyone should be aiming to simultaneously accomplish more while also spending less time online.\n","Minimize your screen time.\n","In other words, simply aiming to spend less time on the Internet in general is a good start. While it may seem counter-intuitive, we tend to be more productive when we have a shorter window in which to get something done.\n","Avoid multitasking.\n","While it might seem like its more productive to do two or three things at once, it can actually slow us down in the long run, as were not able to give our full attention to any one thing. It might be tempting to switch back and forth between Internet tasks in order to keep things interesting, but try to stick to your Internet to do list, finishing each thing before you move on to the next.\n","Do what you can while offline.\n","If you need to read something longer than a page, such as an article or proposal, see if you can download it, and read it with your browser closed. If you need to write a long email reply, try composing it in Microsoft Word.This will further minimize distractions, by preventing you from going down hyperlink rabbit holes, or protecting you from the bloops or dings of email notifications as they inevitably trickle in.\n","Restrict the time you spend on social networking websites.\n","This is something youre going to want to be tough with yourself about, as these websites are not only black holes for productivity, but also very addictive.If you remember, dopamine thrives on anticipation and the unknown, and social networking sites are never static, always changing as people update their statuses, add photos, like things. And nothing is actually ever as interesting or fulfilling as we think it might be.If you must visit sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc., do so with great awareness, and give yourself a strict time limit. Try using a kitchen timer to keep yourself on track.It's important to actually sign off of and close these websites, rather than just opening a new tab or window on top of them. The easier something is to access, the more tempting it is.\n","Reckon with your email.\n","Try checking your email just three times daily: once in the morning, once around lunch time, and once in the evening. Your email, while necessary, can be as bad for time-management as social networking sites if you are constantly refreshing or checking it incessantly.Make sure to trash, archive, or respond to every new email in each sitting. This will not only save you time in the long run, but will give you a sense of accomplishment as you stay on top of your correspondences.\n","Look outside of yourself for help with self-control.\n","If you are having trouble abiding by the restrictions youve set for yourself, youre not the only one! A majority of people find it challenging to efficiently managing their Internet time. So many people, in fact, there are a bunch of free or cheap downloadable applications out there to help you with just this.

If you're struggling a lot with self-control, this might be something to look into. [4]Having to use the Internet with other people around also has the potential to make you more aware of your bad habits. You'll be less likely to unconsciously browse your way over to your recent ex-boyfriend's Facebook page if you're sitting in the window of a caf where anyone who walks past can see your laptop screen, for instance.If you want to experiment with this idea but aren't ready to make the full-blown commitment of canceling your internet service, try stashing your router at a friend's house for a few days.Or if you live with a roommate or spouse who's not amenable to the idea of going Internet-free, have them change wifi password.\n","How to Work from Home With Data Entry: 15 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Ensure you have the necessary skills.\n","Data entry, like any job, has specific requirements that you will need to meet in order to be considered for the position.

In most office environments, you will see your supervisor or manager regularly throughout the day, so when working from home make sure you keep open lines of communication with them throughout your work day.[8]If you communicate via e-mail, make sure to keep your e-mail window or software open so you can be aware when receiving communications from your management.If you miss a call or message from your supervisor, make sure to get back to them as quickly as you can.\n","Veterinarian-Approved Advice on How to Care for a Hamster\n","Find a place that sells hamsters.\n","If you want to get a furry hamster friend go to the pet store, hamster breeder (if you're looking for a specific coat color for your hamster), or animal shelter to pick one out. Try not to buy from a chain pet store as the hamsters will likely come from mill breeders and have very bad genetics. Instead, choose a rescue or local breeder. Check Craigslist, Gumtree, or Preloved.Hamsters are relatively cheap to purchase. Youll spend far more money on their toys, cages, and healthcare.\n","Choose a healthy hamster.\n","A healthy hamster should have clean ears, a clean and dry bottom, a small rounded stomach, no bald spots or lumps (except for the scent glands on its thighs, which many people mistake for cuts or scabs), clean bright eyes, and healthy teeth which aren't overgrown or curled upwards.If a hamster has wet fur around the rump, be especially wary; this is a sign of wet tail  a bacterial disease that spreads quickly through contact with other hamsters. The fur must be dry and clean. There are antibiotic treatments for wet tail, but if you just now picking out a hamster, try to find one that is healthy.\n","Think about what size hamster you want.\n","Syrian hamsters may reach 5-7 inches (12.7-17.8 cm) in length as adults. Dwarf Campbell hamsters and Dwarf Winter White hamsters reach 3-4 inches (7.6-10.1cm). Chinese hamsters can grow to be 4-5 inches (10.1-12.7cm) long. And Roborovski hamsters barely reach 3 inches (7.6cm) in length as adults.[2]\n","Consider your hamsters coloring.\n","Syrian hamsters are mostly golden, but they can come in a variety of colors. Dwarf Campbell's hamsters are normally a grayish-brown color with a black stripe down their back and with a white stomach. Dwarf Winter White hamsters come in white, with either a purple or grayish tint. Dwarf Roborovski hamsters are a sandy brown with a white stomach. And Chinese hamsters are a dark brown with a cream stomach.[3]\n","Ask to hold the hamster.\n","If the staff or breeder (depending on where you go, of course) is uncomfortable with this, then ask for him to place his hand in the hamster enclosure. Avoid buying a hamster that bites or scratches aggressively. Also do not buy one that is extremely fearful  one that darts, hides, and does not reappear. A curious hamster who sniffs but doesn't climb right into your hand is a good choice. An individual that is curious and nips gently to test your hand (just as some puppies do) is another good choice.\n","Pick the right cage.\n","Your hamster will do best in a cage larger than 800 square inches, although 450 square inches or 30 inches by 15 inches is the minimum. Hamsters require a lot of enrichment; small enclosures are not large enough to accommodate this. It should also be more than 12 inches tall so as to be able to fit an adequately sized wheel, 10-12 inches for Syrians and 8 inches for Dwarfs. You will need an enclosure with a deep base, because hamsters burrow. For this reason, an aquarium style enclosure is best. These also come in much larger sizes than wire cages.An IKEA Detolf is an excellent choice too. Alternatively, the \"cat tray with a wire top\" type of hamster cage does have good natural ventilation.Make sure your cage is not in direct sunlight as your hamster could overheat due to the bright rays magnifying on the aquarium glass. Unless they're second hand, aquariums can be expensive.You can also purchase wire cages, which have great ventilation, however, the amount of bedding you can put in is limited.Many people make DIY cages, which are wallet-friendly and are great to make. One of the most popular and cheapest DIY cages is the bin cage, which is made with a 105-quart bin and mesh attached to the lid.\n","Place the cage in a safe place.\n","Make sure there is plenty of ventilation. Don't place the cage in front of a hot window. Make sure to find a place that is quiet and free of any other household pets such as dogs and cats. This will reduce the stress of your pet hamster. At no point should you let your dogs or cats interact with your hamster.\n","Make sure your hamster cant escape.\n","Youd be amazed at how clever hamsters are at escaping. Make sure all holes are sealed and that no loose or removable parts can be opened by your hamster. Be sure if you have a wire cage that your hamster can't fit through the bars or get stuck. The bar spacing of your hamster's cage should be no more than 0.7 cm apart for Dwarf hamsters and 1 cm for Syrian hamsters. It will need to be even smaller for a baby hamster.\n","Understand your hamsters territorial instincts.\n","House all hamsters by themselves. They are territorial starting at about the age of 5-8 weeks and will fight often to death with another hamster if placed in the same space.Even dwarf hamsters cannot be housed together. While they live together in the wild, this is for breeding and survival purposes, neither of which are needed in captivity.\n","Make up your hamsters bedding.\n","On the ground, there should be a layer of at least 6 inches of bedding, however 10 inches is preferred. This might seem like a lot, but hamsters dig large tunnels in the wild. Many hamsters don't dig if there is too little bedding, so make sure to always add a big layer. Even if your hamster does not appear to be digging, leave the bedding inside in case your hamster really is or would like to start.Softwood shavings such as pine and cedar are just not good for hamsters, as they cause many health issues. They can cause respiratory problems and may contain harmful oils. However, aspen bedding does not contain the same harmful oils and is perfectly safe for your hamster.Never use cotton bedding. This is very dangerous for your hamster because it is indigestible, and strands of the bedding can wrap around limbs and extremities cutting off circulation and potentially killing your hamster.Make sure that the bedding that is used can support tunnels, and will not collapse when the hamster tries to burrow.\n","Feed the hamster every day.\n","Hamsters are omnivores, meaning that they need to eat a varied diet of seeds, grains, sometimes nuts, insects, vegetables, and sometimes fruit. You should provide your hamster with a high-quality, varied seed mix. Provide your hamster with enough food each day to fill both cheeks, approximately 15g (1/2oz) for a Syrian hamster or 8g (1/4oz) for a Dwarf hamster. Make sure you provide fresh food every day.If you want to change your hamster's food, wait a few weeks after taking it home; then gradually introduce the food over a period of ten days. Your hamster is a hoarder, so it'll keep private stashes. Removing these stashes can be very stressful, so if you are worried about the quality of their stored food, remove it and replace it with fresh food exactly where your hamster had it.[4]Choose an earthenware or metal dish for their food. This is the best type of feeding bowl as your hamster will simply chew through a plastic one.\n","Have water ready and available at all times.\n","Your hamster won't drink much water at all, but when it does get thirsty, it is important that water is available. It's best to provide the hamster with a glass water dish, as the hamster can drink more easily from the dish than from a bottle. Water dished are also far more easier to clean. Change it every day to keep the water fresh.\n","Use a seed mix rather than pellets.\n","Seed mixes provide the hamster with far more variety and enrichment than a pelleted food. If you are worried about the hamster selecting certain bits, wait until the hamster has eaten all of the seeds provided before offering more food.[5]\n","Spread the food around the cage and hide it in toys and tunnels.\n","Make your hamster search for it. If you place it in a bowl, your hamster may become overweight and less interested in physical activity.\n","Avoid human foods.\n","This includes things such as candy, pasta, raw meat/fish, sugar, and desserts. Hamsters can develop diabetes. Foods that you might not consider high in sugar content will be too sugary for your hamster. This can be damaging to their health.[6]\n","Give it treats.\n","Regularly feed treats twice or three times a week. Hamster favorites include carrots, cucumber, apples, bananas, peppers, lettuce, celery, kale, collard and dandelion greens, and a bounty of other vegetables and fruits. Some of these foods can also be used in a hamster's daily diet. Many pet store treats, like yogurt chips and hamster chocolate drops are mainly made of sugar and fat, which are not good for the hamster, and should be avoided. Some veggies and fruits are NOT safe to feed to your hamsters. Onions, almonds, beans, potatoes, fruits with seeds, avocados, chives, eggplants, scallions, spices, leeks, garlic, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and citrus fruits are big no-nos.\n","Give your hamster a chew stick.\n","These come in many different sizes, colors, and flavors. Since your hamsters teeth grow constantly, it'll need to slowly grind them down. Chew sticks are good for this. Keep trying new ones until you find one your hamster enjoys. Some hamsters will shun all chew sticks. If this is the case, you can expect your hamster to chew on other things in its habitat like the bars of its cage.\n","Leave your hamster alone to explore its new home.\n","When first bringing your hamster home, place it in its cage, with fresh food and water, and leave it alone. Cover the hamster's cage with a light cloth so that it can explore the cage or habitat in privacy. Make sure there is enough food, water, and toys to keep the hamster occupied for a few days, as you will not go near the hamster during this initial period. If there are children, friends, or guests in the house, make sure they know not to disturb the hamster.\n","Introduce yourself gradually.\n","After about three days of leaving your hamster alone, you and your hamster can start to become acquainted. When approaching the cage, speak softly to alert the hamster of your presence. Your hamster may be nervous at first, but remember he or she is not used to you yet and don't be discouraged. Start the things you should do daily such as changing food and water, as well as replacing old toys and putting in new toys. Also, try to remove soiled bedding. Your hamster will start to get used to your hand being in the cage.[7]\n","Begin the taming process.\n","Have short taming sessions starting on the second week of your hamster being in its new home. Most hamsters are active during the early to late evening and throughout the night. Try to learn the hamster's individual routine and do taming sessions when it is most active. A good way to tame your hamster is to put your hamster in an empty bathtub then get in yourself. Bring in a few toys for your hamster to play with whilst it's getting used to your presence. Do not force your hamster to play if it does not want to. If during the training stage your hamster bites/scratches do not punish it.[8]To tame your hamster, place your hand in the cage. Let your hamster sniff it and explore it. If the hamster nips gently and not out of aggression, pull your hand back gently, but immediately let it explore your hand again. This will help the hamster learn that the hand is nothing to bite or fear. Next, place treats in your hand; seed mixtures are good for this because as a supplement to the pellet or block-type diet, hamsters love this food. Your hamster should become used to climbing onto your hand, learning that the hand is something to climb into. Gradually move the treat up your hand, as your hamster will become more and more comfortable climbing onto it.If your hamster is showing good progress, try to let your hamster climb onto your hand and offer it treats right after it has. Your hamster will see your hand as a good thing. This time, let your hamster climb onto your hand and lift the hand slowly off of the cage floor. Your hamster may be frightened at first, but speak softly and offer it treats to make it feel more comfortable. Sit on the floor during this step, as your hamster may decide to leap out of your hands and can be injured once falling from about 6-8 inches (15-20cm) off the ground.[9]\n","Respect its sleeping cycle.\n","Although hamsters are nocturnal animals, they do shuffle around some in the day to get food and such. Although it may seem awake, it's not in the mood to play, unless you see that it feels otherwise. Likewise, keep other people around the hamster to a minimum. It's important that the hamster only bonds with you for now, as it will have plenty of friends later. But now, it needs to know that you are its companion and you will never harm it.\n","Get a suitable hamster wheel.\n","The wheels that come with the cages are generally too small and isn't good for the hamster's back. A wheel is too small if your hamster's back curves upwards. Buy one that is minimum 20cm (7.9in) for a dwarf hamster and 28cm (11in) for a Syrian. Don't be afraid to go bigger. Dwarf hamsters find it easier to control a larger wheel; they may fly off a smaller wheel and injure themselves.Hamsters have a necessity for a solid wheel. If the wheel has gaps in it, it could injure the hamster.\n","Be sure that you have lots of toys for the hamster to enjoy.\n","Toys such as toilet paper rolls, empty tissue boxes, tubes, tunnels, nest boxes, PVC piping, and hamster chew toys are fun for your hamster. Most hamster owners simply give the hamster a wheel and a ball to enjoy. As a result, the hamster will start to have unhealthy habits such as pacing and/or chewing the bars of a wire cage, if housed in a wire cage. Your hamster needs more than just wheels and balls to occupy itself. Have enough toys so that you can rotate them and keep your hamster interested.\n","Set up a playpen.\n","Your hamster will relish the chance to explore outside of their cages. Having play areas also helps when you clean the habitat and need a place to put your hamster where it can't escape. You can use a plastic storage bin in your house or a small animal playpen sold in pet stores.Make sure that there are no dangerous items that the hamster has access to (such as electrical cords which your hamster will chew on) and that the room is escape-proof.\n","Place your hamster in a safe place.\n","While you are cleaning their home, place your hamster in a playpen. You want to take your time while you clean and youll need both hands. Do not try to hold on to your hamster with one hand while you clean with the other. It wont be good for your cleaning job or for your hamster.[10]\n","Clean the cage thoroughly.\n","Use regular dish soap mixed with water. Even the tiniest trace of other types of soap (like hand-wash) can prove uncomfortable for your furry buddy. Use special hamster or rodent cleaning soap, which you can buy from most pet shops.[11]You can also use a vinegar solution to clean the hamsters habitat.[12]\n","Rinse the cage and let dry.\n","Make sure that all the water has evaporated and all of the cleaning solution has been removed. Remember that hamsters have sensitive noses and the scent of vinegar or soap will be bothersome.[13]\n","Replace their bedding.\n","In order to retain the hamster's scent on the bedding, mix a small amount of unspoiled bedding with new bedding. Cheap bedding can be found at most grocery stores. Another good bedding is shredded tissue; you could also use shredded paper towel. Do not use newspapers, as the hamster will lick the ink off it and this will make it extremely ill. Never use pine or cedar wood shavings, as they are unhealthy for hamsters. Aspen is fine.[14]\n","3 Ways to Protect Yourself in Your Home - wikiHow\n","Keep your doors and windows locked, even while youre home.\n","Although a determined intruder can get past a locked door, always lock your doors and windows. Additionally, check that the locks are working well and feel secure.

Dont let them see what they can steal from you. The best way to do this is to cover your windows with curtains or blinds. In addition, doing this can deter potential harassers (e.g. peeping toms and stalkers) from looking into your house.[3]Its easier for them to see inside your home at night when the lights are on. Always shut your curtains after the sun goes down.\n","Install outdoor lighting so theres nowhere for an intruder to hide.\n","Intruders dont want to be seen, so theyre less likely to break in if the area around your home is well-lit.

They might help keep your home well-lit without you having to install as many outdoor lights.\n","Install a security camera at your front door or over your garage.\n","A camera may act as a deterrent for would-be criminals if they can see it. They dont want to get caught, so they might think twice about breaking into your home. If they do still break in, the police can use your camera footage to help catch them. In addition, if the home intruder gets prosecuted, your camera footage will automatically get him/her convicted in court and potentially send him/her to jail.For instance, you might install a visible camera over your garage as a deterrent. Additionally, you could install a video doorbell to document who comes to your door.\n","Replace your bedroom door with a heavy wooden door that locks.\n","Most interior doors are thin and easy to kick down. For extra protection, install a thick wooden door to keep your bedroom more secure. Make sure that the door has a strong lock.

However, in most cases, there are at least subtle clues that usually get rationalized or marginalized. Early warning signs of heart disease include high blood pressure, sensation of chronic heartburn, reduced cardiovascular fitness, and a vague feeling of malaise or being unwell. These symptoms may start many days or weeks before the heart muscle gets damaged enough to become dysfunctional.[1]Symptoms in women are particularly hard to recognize and are ignored or missed even more often.Major risk factors for heart disease, heart attack, and stroke include: high blood cholesterol levels, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cigarette smoking and advancing age (65 years and older).A heart attack doesn't always lead to cardiac arrest (complete heart stoppage), but cardiac arrest is always indicative of a heart attack.\n","Recognize the most common symptoms of a heart attack.\n","Most heart attacks do not occur suddenly or \"out of the blue.\" Instead, they typically start slowly with mild chest pain or discomfort that builds over many hours or even days. The chest pain (often described as intense pressure, squeezing or achiness) is located in the center of the chest and can be constant or intermittent. Other common symptoms of a heart attack include: shortness of breath, cold sweats (with pale or ashen skin), dizziness or lightheadedness, moderate-to-severe fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain and a sensation of severe indigestion.[2]Not all people who experience heart attacks have the same symptoms or the same severity of symptoms  there's lots of variability.Some people also report feeling a sense of \"doom\" or \"impending death\" that is unique to the heart attack experience.Most people experiencing a heart attack (even a mild one) will collapse to the ground, or at least fall against something for support. Other common causes of chest pain don't typically lead to sudden collapse.\n","Recognize some of the less common symptoms of a heart attack.\n","In addition to the tell-tale symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and cold sweats, there are some less common symptoms characteristic of myocardial infarction that you should be familiar with in order to better gauge the probability of heart failure. These symptoms include pain or discomfort in other areas of the body, such as the left arm (or sometimes both), mid-back (thoracic spine), front of the neck and/or lower jaw.[3]Women are more likely than men to experience less common symptoms of heart attack, particularly mid-back pain, jaw pain, and nausea/vomiting.Other diseases and conditions can mimic some of the symptoms of heart attack, but the more signs and symptoms you experience, the greater the likelihood your heart is the cause.\n","Call emergency services\n","immediately. Act immediately and call 9-1-1 or other emergency services in your area if you suspect someone is having a heart attack. Even if they don't display all or even the majority of the signs and symptoms, calling for medical help is the most important action you can take for someone in severe distress. Emergency medical services (EMS) can begin treatment as soon as they arrive and are trained to revive someone whose heart has completely stopped.[4]If you can't call 9-1-1 for some reason, ask a bystander to call and give you updates as to the estimated arrival of emergency services.Patients with chest pain and suspected heart attack who arrive by ambulance usually receive faster attention and treatment at hospitals.\n","Put the person in a seated position, with knees raised.\n","Most medical authorities recommend sitting a suspected heart attack sufferer down in the \"W position\"  semi-recumbent (sitting up at about 75 degrees to the ground) with knees bent.[5] The person's back should be supported, perhaps with some pillows if at home or against a tree if outside. Once the person is in the W position, then loosen any loose clothing around his neck and chest (such as his necktie, scarf, or top buttons of his shirt) and try to keep him still and calm. You may not know what's causing his discomfort, but you can reassure him that medical help is on its way and that you'll stay with him at least until that point.The person should not be allowed to walk around.Keeping a person calm while having a heart attack is certainly a challenge, but avoid being too chatty and asking lots of irrelevant personal questions. The effort required to answer your questions may be too taxing to the person.While waiting for emergency help, keep the patient warm by covering him with a blanket or jacket.\n","Ask the person if she carries nitroglycerine.\n","People with a history of heart problems and angina (chest and arm pain from heart disease) are often prescribed nitroglycerine, which is a powerful vasodilator that causes large blood vessels to relax (dilate) so more oxygenated blood can reach the heart.[6] Nitroglycerine also reduces the painful symptoms of a heart attack. People often carry their nitroglycerin with them, so ask if that's the case and then assist the person in taking it while waiting for emergency personnel to arrive. Nitroglycerin is available as little pills or a pump spray, both of which are administered under the tongue (sublingually). The spray (Nitrolingual) reportedly is faster acting because it's absorbed quicker than the pills.If unsure of the dosage, administer one nitroglycerine pill or two pumps of the spray under the tongue.After administration of nitroglycerine, the person may become dizzy, lightheaded, or faint soon after, so make sure she is secured, sitting down, and not in danger of falling and hitting her head.\n","Administer some aspirin.\n","If you or the heart attack sufferer has any aspirin, then administer it if there's no indication of allergy. Ask the person if he has an allergy and look for any medical bracelets on his wrists if he has trouble talking. Provided he is not younger than 18 years old, give him a 300 mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly.[7] Aspirin is a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can reduce heart damage by \"thinning\" the blood, which means preventing it from clotting. Aspirin also reduces associated inflammation and helps reduce the pain of a heart attack.Chewing the aspirin allows the body to absorb it faster.Aspirin can be taken concurrently with nitroglycerine.A dose of 300 mg is either one adult tablet or two to four baby aspirins.Once at the hospital, stronger vasodilating, \"clot-busting,\" anti-platelet and/or pain-relieving (morphine-based) drugs are given to people experiencing heart attacks.[8]\n","Initiate CPR if the person stops breathing.\n","Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) involves chest compressions in order to help push some blood through the arteries (especially to the brain) combined with rescue breathing (mouth to mouth), which provides some oxygen to the lungs.[9] Keep in mind that CPR has its limitations and doesn't usually trigger a heart to start beating again, but it can provide some precious oxygen to the brain and buy some time before emergency services arrive with their electrical defibrillators. Regardless, take a CPR class and at least learn the basics.When someone starts CPR before emergency support arrives, people have a better chance of surviving a heart attack or stroke.People not trained in CPR should only do chest compressions and avoid rescue breathing. If the person doesn't know how to effectively deliver rescue breathing, they will simply be wasting time and energy by improperly administering breaths that are not effective.Keep in mind that time is very important when an unconscious person stops breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after four to six minutes without getting oxygen, and death can occur as soon as four to six minutes after enough tissue is destroyed.[10]\n","How to Skin and Clean Catfish\n","Make shallow slanted cuts behind the gills on each side that meet in the stomach.\n","Use your filet knife to cut just behind the gills at a 45-degree angle towards the head. Only cut between  inch (3.26.4mm) deep or else it will be more difficult to remove the skin. Cut around the bottom of the head to connect the two cuts. Make sure the filet knife youre using is sharp. A dull knife wont cut as easily and is more dangerous than a sharp knife.\n","Cut along the fishs spine from its head to its tail.\n","Start your cut at the base of the head, and pull your knife down the fishs body. Use a shallow cut just to break through the skin, or about  inch (3.26.4mm) deep. When you reach the top fin, or dorsal fin, work your knife around it rather than straight through it. End your cut right at the tail.[1]Be careful of the sharp barb on the end of the dorsal fin. It could puncture your skin and depending on the species of catfish, it may contain a poison or toxin.\n","Slice open the skin down the center of the fishs belly.\n","Make another  inch (3.26.4mm) deep cut along the stomach, starting at the incision you made around the head. Work the knife towards the tail, ending your cut right when the fin starts.[2]Dont cut too deep or else youll puncture the fishs internal organs.\n","Make vertical slits on each side of the tail.\n","Look for the area on the fishs tail where the scales stop and the fin begins. Use your filet knife to make a  inch (3.26.4mm) deep cut from the spine to the belly. These cuts should intersect with the other 2 cuts youve made.\n","Clamp the pliers on the skin below the fishs gills.\n","Peel a small part of the skin back with your finger before gripping it with a pair of pliers. Grab a large enough piece of skin so that youre using the entire surface area of your pliers.[3]To get a better grip or loosen more of the skin, twist the pliers.\n","Peel the skin back towards the tail in one fluid motion.\n","Hold the catfishs head down with your hand to keep it pressed against the cutting board. Pull the skin away from the head slowly so it doesnt rip or break. When you reach the tail, the skin should easily pull off of the fish. Repeat the process on the other side.[4]Wear gloves when you hold down the catfishs head since their whiskers could hurt your hand.\n","Twist the head off just below the gills.\n","First, bend the head back towards the spine to snap the fishs neck. Put the fishs head back in place and twist it. As you twist the head, pull it away from the body to completely remove it.[5]If you dont feel comfortable twisting the head off the body, use a butchers knife to chop the head off behind the gills.\n","Remove the tail and all the fins.\n","Use a pair of kitchen scissors or a filet knife to cut off all the fins, including the tail. Cut as close to the base of the fin as you can to remove it entirely.To remove the dorsal fin completely, cut around it with your filet knife about  inch (1.3cm) deep. Use your pliers to pull the fin out of the body.\n","Make a slit through the fishs stomach and pull out the entrails with your finger.\n","Use your filet knife to completely cut through the fishs stomach. Run your finger through the inside of the fish starting on the side closest to the tail. Scoop out all of the internal organs and throw them away. Wear nitrile gloves if you dont want to touch the fish.Put the fish organs in a separate garbage bag and throw it outside so your kitchen garbage doesnt stink.\n","Wash the body out with cold water.\n","Run the meat of the fish under your faucet to clean out any blood or residue from inside the body. When youre finished, pat the fish dry with a paper towel and put it back on your cutting board.[6]Only use cold water since hot water could start cooking the fish.\n","Cut down along the spine towards the ribs.\n","Slowly work the tip of your filet knife down the spine to separate the meat from the bones. Use short strokes to cut around the rib cage to keep bones out of your filet. Work down the entire length of the rib cage from the head towards the tail.[7]If you have smaller catfish around 1416 inches (3641cm), consider cooking your catfish whole.\n","Poke the knife through the belly of the fish and cut towards the tail.\n","Hold the fish still with your non-dominant hand. Put your knife in between the spine and filet and push it through the fish until it the blade comes out of the belly. Once you see the tip of the knife through the belly, slowly cut the filet towards the tail.[8]Dont put your fingers where you plan to poke through the fish or else you will cut yourself.\n","Cut back towards the front of the fish to remove the filet.\n","Lift the tail portion of the filet away from the rib cage with your non-dominant hand. Cut through the bottom of the fish still connected to the filet. Once you remove the first filet, set it aside.[9]\n","Remove the filet from the other side.\n","Flip the fish over and repeat the process on the other side. Work slowly to ensure you get all of the meat off the bones. Set the second filet aside once its removed. After the fish has been completely cleaned, either throw away the bones or make a stock from them.[10]Catfish filets can be fried, grilled, or baked.If you make catfish nuggets, make sure they are fully thawed and patted dry.You can apply the seasoning as a crust or batter. So, you can use a seasoned cornmeal crust or a liquid batter like a beer batter.Then drop the catfish into a fryer or hot oil. The oil should be at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Cook them for about 10 to 15 minutes.\n","10 Ways to Live for Jesus - wikiHow\n","Set aside a quiet time for prayer.\n","Prayer is how we build a personal relationship with God.[1][2] In fact, there are several times when the Bible describes Jesus going to a quiet place to pray. If the Son of God needed prayer as part of His spiritual life, imagine how important it is for you. Follow Jesus' example and make it a priority to spend some time each day talking to God and listening for His guidance.[3]Pray about everything, from your troubles and sins to things you're excited about. Pray that God will help you make the right decisions in your own life, and pray for other people who are hurting or who haven't found God yet.[4]\n","Honor Jesus by giving your time and energy to other people.\n","Even though he was God's Son, Jesus didn't come here and demand that others bow down and wait on His every need. He fed people who were hungry, healed people who were sick, and even humbled Himself enough to wash someone's feet. If you want to live your life for Him, treat others the way He didby helping them when they're in need, forgiving them when they do things wrong, and loving them no matter what. Try volunteering your time helping people in need in your community, like working at a soup kitchen or organizing a clothing drive.You can also serve people in a less formal way, like buying a sandwich for someone who's hungry or listening to a friend who's having a hard time.Share the gifts God has given you as a way to serve otherswhether it's wisdom, wealth, or a talent like musical ability.\n","You have to understand God's word to live for Him.\n","If you want to live forand likeJesus, you have to know what He was like.[5] The first 4 books of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) tell us about Jesus' life and the lessons He taught His followers. This can be a great place to start studying God's word, but don't stop there. Jesus instructed us to \"keep the commandments\" in Matthew 19:17, making it clear that it's important to understand all of God's law in order to really live like him.[6]Try setting aside a little time each day to read your Bible. Even 5-10 minutes can help you understand the love of Jesus.[7] It can help to do this at the same time every day, like as soon as you wake up, on your lunch break, or before you go to bed.If you're not sure where to start reading, buy a devotional book or sign up for a daily newsletter from a local church. These will give you a specific Scripture to meditate on each day.\n","Tell them about God's love and Jesus' sacrifice.\n","You're usually excited to tell your friends when you see a cool movie or eat at an awesome new restaurant, right? Well, in the same way, the best way to honor the amazing gift of Jesus is to share it with others. When you're spreading that love, you're truly living for Jesus and making Him the biggest priority in your life.[8]In Matthew 5:14, the Bible says, \"You are the light of the world.\" That means it's your job to share the light and hope of God's word with the people around you who are living in sin and hopelessness.[9]Try joining an outreach ministry in your church to spread the message of Jesus while helping people in need.You could also share the story of what God has done in your life with the people you meet.\n","Pray that God will help you be strong against sin.\n","Being a Christian doesn't mean that you'll never be tempted to sin. Jesus was the only person who never sinned, and even he was tempted by Satan! When you get saved, though, you're given the gift of the Holy Spirit, which will guide you to know what's right and wrong. And your faith in Jesus will give you the strength to make choices that will please God.[10]In Matthew 6:13, Jesus prayed, \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\" You can use this same prayer when you're asking God to help you avoid sin.[11]In 1 Corinthians 10:13, the Bible promises that you have the strength to overcome the urge to sin: \"No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability.\"\n","Make Him the most important thing in your life.\n","God's very first commandment is not to put any other gods higher than Him. However, it's more than just not following another religionit means not having anything in your life that's more important to you than God. Ask yourselfwhere do you turn when you're upset? What makes you the most excited in your life? Do those things glorify God?[12]In Ezekiel 14:3, the Bible describes idols as \"things that will make [you] fall into sin.\" Idols can include harmful habits and substances, but they can also be things that are normally considered positive, like your career, friends, school, video games, or sports, if they interfere with your relationship with God.If you're willing to lie or steal or cheat to accomplish or obtain something, it's almost certainly an idol in your life. However, the sin might be more subtle, like getting angry or being jealous of someone else if you can't have it.[13]God is all-powerful and all-knowing, but He's also loving and forgiving, and He wants us to live for Him.\n","What's waiting in heaven is more important than on earth.\n","When you're living for Jesus, remember that your goal is ultimately to join God in heaven, and to do as much as you can to serve Him in the meantime.[14] That means that you shouldn't put too much stock in obtaining money or possessions like clothes, electronics, or jewelrythey won't do you any good in your eternal life. [15]You can have nice things, and you can even enjoy themthey're blessings from God, after all. Just don't let the pursuit of them distract you from serving God.In Matthew 19:21, Jesus tells a rich man, \"If you would be perfect, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\"[16]\n","Look to Him for guidance even when times are hard.\n","In Romans 8:28, the Bible promises that everything you go through is part of God's plan for you: \"And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good.\" This is true even when you're faced with incredible struggles, like sickness, poverty, or the loss of loved ones. Just keep praying that God will show you His will, and that He will be glorified through whatever you go through.[17]That doesn't mean you have to always be happy about difficult circumstances. Jesus showed us this when He wept as He mourned the death of his friend Lazarus, even though He was about to bring him back to life!In Matthew 22:39, Jesus even prayed that God would help Him avoid being crucified. And yet, He still acknowledged the perfectness of God's plan when He said, \"Not as I will, but as you will.\"\n","Rely on each other for support when you need it.\n","Jesus was the perfect Son of God, but He surrounded Himself with companionsnot just to teach them about God, but to help support Him when He needed it, too. In Matthew 26:38, as Jesus was facing death, He asked His friends Peter, James, and John to join Him as He prayed. That's a really powerful illustration of why Christians should spend time building strong, loving relationships with other followers.[18]When you meet together, spend time praying, reading the Bible, and listening to each other. That fellowship will help you all grow as you follow Jesus.\n","Jesus spent time with both sinners and believers.\n","Being a Christian doesn't mean shutting yourself off from anyone who doesn't believe the way you do. God calls us to love our neighborsnot just other Christians. You don't even have to spend all your time trying to convert non-believers. Spend time with them, listen to their problems, and be there when they need you. As they see Jesus working in your life, it may make them more curious to learn more about Him when they're ready.[19]For instance, if you have a friend who doesn't go to church, you can invite them to yours, but don't pressure them too much. As long as you're not tempted to sin when you're with them, it's fine to hang out how you normally would, like going to a ball game or having dinner together.Show Jesus' love by encouraging and motivating others instead of criticizing them or putting them down.\n","6 Ways to Make a Superhero Costume - wikiHow\n","Sport some spandex.\n","All superheroes wear a tight get-up of some sort, whether it be a unitard, leggings, or a full-body suit.

There are several methods for making a mask at home.\n","Make a paper mask.\n","Hold up a piece of sturdy cardstock to your face and have a friend mark two dots where the outside edges of your eyes are, and one dot where the tip of your nose is (you can also use a paper plate).Draw the mask out on the piece of paper, using the dots as reference points for how big your mask needs to be.Cut out the shape of your mask and poke two holes in each side near where your ears will be.Attach a ribbon or string to each hole so that you can tie the mask behind your head.Decorate the outline with colored markers, paint, sequins, feathers, glitter, or any other embellishments that suit your superpower.\n","Create a mask using tin foil and tape.\n","Stack three sheets of aluminum foil together and press the stack on your face to create an impression in the tin foil.Outline where your eyes and any other openings will be with a marker. Use scissors to cut around the edges of the mask, the eyes, the mouth, and any other openings you outlined.Poke a hole in each side of the mask near where your ears will be and attach a string or ribbon to hold the mask on your face.Making sure to keep the mold firm, cover the mask in strong clear tape such as packing tape.Decorate with acrylic paint and any other embellishments such as feathers or sequins.\n","Make a papier mch mask.\n","Blow up a balloon to about the size of your head. Lay newspaper flat on a table or the floor to use as a working surface.Tear strips of newspaper or cut strips of thin cloth into long strips.Combine 2 cups flour and 1 cup water in a mixing bowl. You can use 2 cups of white glue in place of flour if you don't have any flour handy.Dip the strips of paper or cloth into the mixture completely and begin to lay them on the balloon until the entire balloon is covered. Be sure to place the strips at random, intersecting angles.Allow it to dry completely and then take a needle and pop the balloon. Cut the globe in half using strong scissors starting at the base of the balloon where it was tied and cutting up over the peak of the globe.Shape the mask to fit your face, cut out any openings for your eyes or mouth, and finally, decorate it with paint and any other decorations you choose!\n","Find a piece of fabric.\n","Most superheroes wouldn't be caught without this most dashing of accessories.

Begin to tape on top of the plastic in small pieces, trying to keep the tape as flat as possible. Be careful not to tape too tightly around your leg.Once you've covered the entire surface of your boot, you are ready to start trick-or-treating!If you are making the boots in advance, however, you can use scissors to carefully cut a line down the back of the boot so that you can slip your foot out. When you want to wear the boots, slip them on over your sneakers and re-tape the back slit with duct tape.For a more polished look, add a few inches of duct tape to the top of the boot to make them flare out slightly.[1]\n","Sew felt boots.\n","Step on a piece of paper and trace your left and right feet with a marker, allowing about 1/4-inch of extra space between the outline and your foot.Use a tape measure to measure from the tip of the toes to the tip of the boot on your calf and the circumference of your calf at the highest point on the boot. Add about 2 inches (5.1cm) to the circumference measurement to allow the boot to flare out.Transfer an outline of these two measurements to a separate piece of paper and connect them to make a rough upside-down T shape. Repeat for your other foot.Cut out the two sole pieces and the four body pieces and lay them on your felt. Lightly trace the shape of each paper template onto the felt with a pen or pencil and cut out the four felt pieces.Pin two of the body pieces in an L-shape on top of your foot and sew the pieces together along the top seam that runs across the top of your foot, and the back seam that runs up the back of your leg. Turn the boot inside-out to hide the seam.Pin the sole piece to the L-shaped tube and sew around the edges at least twice for a strong seam. Repeat this process for the second boot, and you're finished!\n","Accessorize your superhero outfit.\n","Carry a fake weapon or decorate your outfit in a way that shows the neighborhood kids just what you're capable of in superhero mode.For example, if you have the ability to transform into an animal of some sort, cut out a design using paper or felt and attach it to the front of your shirt or the back of your cape.If you are planning to be an existing superhero character, make sure your accessory matches theirs.\n","Become Superman.\n","Superman's superpowers are a part of his being.

In federal court, it is simply called a subpoena to produce documents.[3] Call or visit the court where your case is pending and ask for a subpoena form. You can also visit youre the courts website to see if the form is there.If your case is in Federal Court, you can find the subpoena form at the Federal Court website.If your case is in state court be aware that, in some states, there are different subpoena forms for subpoenaing records or subpoenaing a person to appear.[4] Make sure the form you get is the form for subpoenaing documents (not people).[5]Also be aware that in some states you will use a subpoena for business records form. For example, in California, if you want to subpoena bank records, you will have to fill out a form for the production of business records.[6]There may be different forms for different types of cases in your state. For example, your case could be a civil, criminal or family court matter. Take care to get the proper subpoena for the type of case you have.There are different types of courts. For example, there are circuit courts (federal and state), family courts, civil courts and chancery courts in some states, that may have different forms.[7],  Make sure you go to the court where your case is pending to obtain the form.\n","Fill in the subpoena form.\n","The form includes blanks and clear instructions for completing it. Take care to follow the instructions and complete the form. The information you need to input on the form includes:Legal name of your court case and the case number[8]Name and address of the bank or corporation you want to serve with the subpoena[9] It could be the opposing party or a third-party bank. You should serve the person at the bank who oversees the department that has the documents you need.[10] If you do not already have the persons name, you will need to do some research to identify who that person is. Alternatively, you can serve the registered agent of service for the bank, if you cannot find a person to subpoena.Name and address of the court where the documents should be sent[11] Since the court is issuing the subpoena, the records will be returned to the court.[12]Date and time the records should be sent by  keep in mind the date typically  cannot be sooner than 14 business days after the service date[13]Specify the records you want produced[14] Typically, these types of documents are requested from banks: bank statements, deposit tickets, signature cards, cancelled checks, loan documents, mortgage documents, investment documents and correspondence.It is extremely important that you describe the documents with enough specificity for the bank to produce them. If the bank does not know what to look for they will not give you any documents. For example, if you are looking for a bank statement, describe the statement using the person's name, bank account number, and routing number.Your name as the requesting party.\n","Visit the court where your case is pending and get your subpoena signed.\n","[15] The clerk of courts or deputy clerk of court generally signs subpoenas. Present your completed form to the clerk and request his or her signature.In some states, the clerk of courts does not need to sign off on the subpoena at all.[16]\n","Serve the subpoena on parties to the case, first.\n","Under Federal law and in many states, before you can serve the subpoena on the bank, you must serve the subpoena on the other parties to your case.[17]\n","Find the right person to serve the subpoena on the bank.\n","The person serving the subpoena must be over 18 years old and can not be a party to your lawsuit.[18] For a fee of about $50, you can hire a professional process server to serve your subpoena.\n","Identify the person at the bank who should receive the subpoena.\n","The subpoena should be served on the person at the bank who oversees the department that has the documents.[19] You may need to do some online or phone research to determine who that person is. If you cannot identify a person to serve, then you should serve it on the banks registered agent for service.You can typically find this information on the secretary of state's website or by doing an online search of the bank. If you are doing a generic online search, try searching for the bank's name followed by \"agent for service\" or \"office where subpoenas for records should be sent.\" If you cannot find anyone by doing these things, call the bank.\n","Serve the subpoena through your process server.\n","Your process server will need to deliver the subpoena by hand to the bank representative. If you were unable to find a person to subpoena, the process server will need to personally serve the bank's registered agent for service.[20]\n","Complete and file the proof of service.\n","The person who served the subpoena should complete the proof of service page of the subpoena. He or she will have to fill in the name of the person served, the date served, his or her fee for serving and an attestation, under oath, that the information is true.[21],[22] After completion, the server should file the proof of service page with the court.\n","Know the costs associated with getting the records.\n","Generally, the party requesting the documents will have to pay for their production. These costs will include the cost of finding the documents and the cost of copying the documents.Because of this, it is incredibly important to narrow the scope of your request as much as possible. If your request is too broad, you may have to pay a lot of money to have documents found and copied.In some cases, if your request is too time-consuming or expensive to fulfill, the bank will call you and ask about reducing the request.\n","Wait for approximately two weeks.\n","Most subpoenas give subpoenaed parties two weeks to produce the records. Make a note to contact the court after two weeks, to see if the bank has produced the records.[23],[24]\n","Check to see if your subpoenaed records arrived.\n","Your records may arrive in a number of different locations depending on the type of case you are a part of and how you asked for the records to be produced. In California, you can ask for paper or digital copies, which can be sent to you at your office. In some cases, for example criminal cases, documents are often sent to the court and can be examined there. In other circumstances, the bank may call you and tell you the documents are ready to be examined at the bank.The manner in which subpoenaed documents will get to you varies drastically from state to state. You should ask the bank how they plan on delivering the documents so you know what to expect.\n","Be aware that the bank may object to the subpoena and file a Motion to Quash it.\n","If this happens, you should receive a copy of the motion from the bank. The court will schedule a hearing to resolve the dispute.[25] Be prepared to present to the court all of the reasons you need the bank records to prove your case. The court will make a decision whether, by law, you are entitled to obtain the documents.When a party submits a motion to quash, they are objecting to the idea that they should have to produce the documents in question. While there are many reasons to object to a subpoena, some common reasons for doing so include the argument that the information is privileged and the argument that the records are not relevant to the case.When an opposing party or the bank files a motion to quash, you will have to respond with a motion of your own. When you respond, you will have to explain why the records are relevant and why the law allows you to subpoena them. If you have hired an attorney, they will do this for you. In addition, the attorney will go to any required hearings on the issue.\n","How to Print a Document, Picture, or File: Windows & Mac\n","Make sure that your printer is connected and turned on.\n","If your printer connects over Wi-Fi, this will mean making sure that you're on the same Internet network as your printer; otherwise, you'll need to plug your printer's USB cable into your computer.Check your printer's manual to confirm how to set it up if you haven't already done so.Be sure to update your printer drivers.\n","Open the document you want to print.\n","This could be a PDF, Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or even photos.Use the File Explorer to find the file if needed.\n","On your keyboard, press Ctrl+P.\n","This is the keyboard shortcut to open the print menu.You can also manually open the print menu by clicking the printer icon.In some apps, you'll need to click File and then Print.The print menu may look different depending on the application used to open your file.\n","Select your printer.\n","Click the \"Printer\" drop-down box, then click your printer's name.If you don't see your printer, you'll need to add it.\n","Select a number of copies.\n","In the \"Copies\" box, type in the number of copies of the document that you'd like to print.This is different than the number of pages.\n","Edit other print settings.\n","The menu for each document type will vary, but you'll have the following options for most documents:Orientation: Determine whether your document is oriented vertically or horizontally.Color: Decide between printing in black and white or including color printing.

Direct contact with HF can cause major damage to your skin tissue, as HF is a corrosive substance that burns. It can also penetrate the skin and cause even further damage under the skin.[1]This can be even worse, depending on the concentration of the acid and the length of exposure.No matter the concentration, however, the burns may cause a deeper penetration of the underlying skin tissue after a longer time of detection. Any increased time can allow for a burn to become more severe.[2]\n","Distinguish the categories of burn.\n","There are 3 categories of HF burns. A burn that is grade 1 appears with white burn mark and has surrounding painful redness along the skin.A burn that is grade 2  appears with a white burn mark and surrounding painful redness, but also demonstrates blistering and edema, which is leakage of intra-cellular fluids outside of damaged cellular tissue.A burn that is grade 3 appears in the same way as grade 2, with the addition of blistering, and necrosis, which is cell tissue death.Cell tissue death is seen as discolored blue or black tissue around the burn. [3]\n","Remove all contaminated clothing immediately.\n","If there is any part of your clothing that has been saturated with HF, remove it immediately from your body or any portion of your skin. This will prevent more acid from touching the skin, as well as stop continued exposure that may cause more serious burning.Make sure that the clothing comes into contact with as little skin as possible as it is removed. Do not touch clothing directly with bare skin if you believe it has also been contaminated with HF.Use gloves, masks, and gowns, if possible.\n","Flush the burned area.\n","If you come into contact with HF, flush the burned area under a safety shower or suitable hose. Orient the burned area so that water runs down and off your skin.  Make sure that the water coming into contact with the affected area does not come into contact with any other part of your body.This constant flow of cool water should not overly cold but cool enough to soothe the burn.Continue flushing the area for fifteen or more minutes.\n","Have another person call for medical assistance.\n","HF burns are very serious and can lead to many systemic issues and even death. You need to get help as soon as possible because HF burns require expert medical attention regardless of how you feel or what you believe is necessary. Have someone else call for you while you deal with preventing continued exposure to the acid.Seek medical attention as soon as possible from the time of exposure to reduce the time the acid can continue to linger and cause damage.[4]\n","Treat the wound after flushing it.\n","You can do a few things after flushing your burn. Massage a generous amount of calcium gluconate gel into and around the burn. Keep applying gel for at least twenty minutes. This should be the first line of care if available after extensive rinsing with water.You can also use hexafluorine, which is a chemical compound that has also been used extensively for HF burns. However, some studies have not found it to be any more effective in reducing electrolyte disturbances than proper rinsing with water.[5]Magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids can also be used with some benefit if calcium gluconate is not available. Look for common antacid brands such as Mylanta.[6]\n","Get treated.\n","Seeking medical care from professionals will help assess long-term side effects of the burn. The goal of treatment is reduce the effects of HF burns while simultaneously controlling the pain from exposure. Prior to discharge, your doctor will assess your electrolyte balances with a blood test, test for any heart palpitations and arrhythmias, and review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to make sure it is normal.Your doctor may continue with similar tests during follow-up to make sure that long-term symptoms do not develop after you have been discharged.If exposure to HF is only on the fingers, you will likely be discharged with calcium gluconate gel and instructed to wear a latex glove after applying the gel.  This will help to maximize the efficacy of the gel by increasing absorption. [7]Your doctor should follow-up with you at least once after 24 hours from the time you are discharged. This follow-up may be in person or over the telephone, depending on the severity of your exposure and the doctor's judgment.\n","Recognize the symptoms.\n","If your eyes are exposed to HF, they will experience rapid symptoms.  If your eyes only have mild exposure, expect rapid irritation and possibly pain.  This may be followed by a clouding of the cornea of the eye, which may be reversible.If severe exposure occurs, expect a rapid onset of pain and damage to the cornea.  The cornea may degrade and the eye may swell.  Clouding of the eye may become permanent as well as any other visual defects in the eye. [8]\n","Flush the eyes with water.\n","As soon as your eyes are exposed to HF, flush them with large amounts of cool, running water for at least thirty minutes. This will flush out the acid and help prevent continued damage to the eyes. If only one eye has been contaminated, be sure to not wash acid into the other eye. Keep your eyelids apart and away from the eyeballs while washing.Tilt your head to the side so that water runs off your eye from the side closest to your nose towards your temples.  This will prevent the contaminated water from rinsing back into your eye, nose, mouth, or other vital areas on the face. [9]\n","Seek medical attention.\n","Once you wash your eyes out, seek medical attention immediately. Ideally, you should see an eye specialist so he or she will know the best way to treat you. This cannot be reiterated enough. HF is a highly reactive substance and can cause severe damage, visual defects, and blindness.\n","Apply an ice pack.\n","On your way to the emergency room, you should apply an ice pack to your eyes. Applying an ice pack to the affected area may lessen the effects of the HF, while also helping to alleviate the painful symptoms.[10]\n","Get treated by an eye doctor.\n","Once you get to the emergency room or eye doctor, he or she will assess the damage in order to limit the long-term effects to your eyes. You will most likely continue to receive flushing of the eye, as well as topical tetracaine ointment and a 1% calcium gluconate flush.The goal of immediate treatment is to reduce your pain, neutralize the effects of burns, and then to assess and come up with a treatment plan based on the outcome.\n","Have tests done.\n","Prior to discharge, your doctor will assess your electrolyte balances with a blood test, test for any heart palpitations and arrhythmias, and review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to make sure it is normal.Your doctor may continue with similar tests during any follow-up to make sure that long-term symptoms do not develop after you have been discharged. Just like with a skin burn, your doctor should follow-up with you at least once after 24 hours from the time you are discharged, which can be over the phone or in person depending on the severity of your case.[11]\n","Recognize the symptoms.\n","The symptoms for inhalation of HF can be complication because the symptoms for mild and severe inhalation will overlap. The symptoms for mild exposure may be include irritation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat, coughing, burns on the passageways, and narrowing of airways, which will cause difficulty breathing.Symptoms for severe exposure include all of the above as well as an immediate narrowing of the airways, along with pulmonary edema, which is a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Lung collapse can also occur.[12]\n","Immediately remove the person from the HF source.\n","You will likely not be able to check yourself for inhalation of HF because of the symptoms. However, if you come upon someone who has or might have inhaled HF, check the affected person's vital signs.Check for a pulse and respiratory breathing on him and make sure his airway is open so that he can breathe.Continue to monitor the individual for any observable symptoms and do your best to alleviate those symptoms as professional medical attention is obtained.If the person looks as though they are having a hard time breathing, administer oxygen if available.Artificial respiration such as CPR is necessary and should be administered by trained professionals if breathing has stopped. [13]\n","Seek medical attention immediately.\n","Inhalation exposure is rapidly lethal, which means you need to seek medical attention as soon as possible.  Inhalation of HF can cause serious damage and treatment should be done in a medical setting because there is little to no effective treatment outside of a clinical setting.While there is a lot of literature and research available about HF exposure to the skin, inhalation exposure has had relatively little research completed. The process of treating HF inhalation injury is highly complex, and more experimental research is still needed to learn proper care techniques.[14]\n","Get treatment at the hospital.\n","If inhalation HF is suspected, time is of the essence and medical attention must begin as soon as possible.[15] Your doctor may do imaging scans and spirometry to assess any damage or decreased functioning of your respiratory system.Spirometry aims to determine your ability to utilize your expected lung capacity and will involve blowing into a tube to measure your effective lung capacity. You will be tested on your ability to inhale, exhale, and the rate at which you can achieve these actions.Just as with other HF exposure, your doctor will take a blood test to check your electrolyte balances, look for any arrhythmias or heart palpitations, and will review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to check for any abnormalities. Your doctor will also follow up within 24 hours of discharge by phone or in person, depending on your case.[16]\n","Recognize symptoms of ingestion.\n","Ingestion can lead to many symptoms, and it can be complicated since symptoms based on systemic exposure cannot be ruled out. Exposure through ingestion can lead to nausea, vomiting, burns to the mouth and airways, and abdominal pain. You may also experience necrosis of areas of the stomach and digestive tract, which can cause severe pain due to localized tissue death.You may also suffer gastric bleeding, which is accompanied by an inflammation of the stomach.Pancreatitis can also be a symptom, which is an inflammation of pancreas that results from internal digestive tract exposure to HF.[17]\n","Drink a lot of water.\n","If you ingested HF, you need to drink a large quantity of water right away. This will help dilute the acid in your system and ease the severity of the damage. Do not induce vomiting.  You can also drink some milk. If exposed person is alert, give them 4-8 ounces of milk or water.Give no more than 4 ounces of either liquid to a child.Be very careful with this kind of exposure. Death has occurred within 90 minutes of ingestion of HF contained in rust remover.[18]\n","Seek medical attention immediately.\n","Ingestional exposure is life threatening and can cause a lot of permanent damage to organs.  Always seek immediate medical attention as soon as you suspect HF exposure. You will likely be started on a treatment regime that will help neutralize the acid, even if you have done it yourself on the way to emergency care.You will be carefully monitored for increased effects of the burn over time, as HF burns can damage your body on a varying time scale depending on the concentration and exposure level.\n","Neutralize the acid.\n","After drinking milk or water and calling for help, it is necessary to attempt to bind certain substances in HF with a neutralizing substance. Take some Tums, which are chewable calcium tablets that can help during HF ingestion. The calcium can help bind the HF in your system.If you don't have Tums, try milk of magnesia, Maalox, or other liquid antacid. Drink 4 to 8 ounces of these liquids to help.Don't overdo it with the liquids by trying multiple methods. You don't want to induce vomiting. Vomiting can cause the acid to further damage unexposed areas that are undamaged.\n","Get additional tests.\n","Your doctor will perform additional blood tests to assess any large decreases in calcium due to binding with the ingested HF.  This can lead to cardiac problems, including cardiac arrest. A urinalysis will also be done in order to assess your fluid levels.  This will help to guide fluid management and help with replenishing of any depleted electrolytes.Your doctor will run the same test as with other forms of exposure, which check for electrolyte balance, heart complications, and other lasting issues.[19]\n","Skin Tear: Wound Care, Medical Treatment, Prevention, & More\n","Clean your hands with soap and water.\n","Before handling your torn skin, wash your hands. This will get rid of bacteria and dirt that could get into the wound and cause an infection.[1] Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water.If you dont have access to soap and water, rub your hands with a hand sanitizer until they feel dry.[2]\n","Wash the skin tear with warm water or sterile saline.\n","Start by washing the skin tear and the surrounding skin with warm water. Alternatively, use a sterile saline wound wash, which you can find at most drugstores. Use your hand to gently wash the area. Do not rub or scrub the area, as this can cause more damage to the skin.[3]Avoid using a towel or cloth to wash the area, as this can irritate the skin tear further. Your hand and running water should work just fine.Make sure you clean the skin tear before you apply a new dressing or bandage to it. This will ensure no bacteria are present in the skin tear before you bandage it.\n","Use a saline wound cleanser as an alternative to water.\n","You can also apply a saline wound cleanser to the skin tear. The wound cleanser will contain water and antibacterial ingredients to help clean the area. Rinse the area thoroughly with the saline, and try to wash away any obvious dirt or debris.[4]When you apply the wound cleanser, do not rub or scrub the area.You can buy a saline wound cleanser at most drugstores.\n","Allow the skin tear to air dry.\n","This may take 10 to 20 minutes. You can also use a soft towel to pat the area dry, being careful not to rub or scrub the area.If you decide to pat the area dry, avoid using tissue, a cotton ball, or any other material that could leave fragments behind in the wound.\n","Tuck the skin flap over the skin tear, if possible.\n","If the skin flap is still attached to the skin tear, use a damp cotton swab or your clean finger to gently ease it back into place. You can also use tweezers or a gloved finger to do this. Putting the flap back in place will help the skin tear to heal properly.[5]Never cut off the skin flap.\n","Cover the tear with a petroleum jelly pad to keep the wound moist.\n","Petroleum jelly gauze (or petrolatum gauze) is a good option for skin tears as it will protect the wound and keep it moist so it can heal. Petroleum jelly gauze comes in strips. Use scissors to cut the gauze to fit the area. Then, apply the gauze over the skin tear, leaving a 1in (2.5cm) around the skin tear.You can get petroleum jelly gauze or other non-stick dressings online or at your local drugstore.Hydrogel dressings are also an excellent way to protect your wound and promote faster healing.[6]\n","Wrap the area with a kerlix bandage.\n","Kerlix bandages are made of thick, stretchy gauze. They will help to protect the skin tear and keep it moist. Wrap the kerlix bandage over the dressing to hold it in place.Kerlix sticks to itself, so you probably wont need to tape it in place. If you have to use medical tape to keep it from unwrapping, make sure you only stick it to the bandage and not to the skin.You can also hold the dressing in place with a stockinette, which is a tube-shaped bandage that fits in place without needing to be wrapped or taped down.\n","Replace the outer bandages at least once a day.\n","To help keep the wound clean while it heals, change the outer dressing (the kerlix bandage or stockinette) once or twice daily, especially during the first 3-4 days after the injury.[7]Change the outer bandages and dressing any time they get wet or dirty.\n","Change the inner dressing every 3-5 days.\n","Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, change the dressing on the skin tear itself every 3-5 days, or more often if blood or other fluids are seeping through the dressing.[8] Lift the bandages off and away from the direction of the attached skin flap. Clean the skin tear with water before you apply a new bandage.While youre changing the dressing, check the skin tear for any signs of infection, such as swelling, odor, pus, or heat coming from the wound. If you suspect the skin tear is infected, or it does not appear to be getting better, see a doctor.\n","Ask the doctor about sealing an open tear with medical glue.\n","If the skin tear causes an open wound, you may need to see a doctor. The doctor can then use medical glue to close the skin tear. This will help the skin tear to heal and prevent the tear from becoming infected.[9]If the skin tear is very painful, the doctor may numb the area before they apply the medical glue.\n","Discuss getting stitches for a severe skin tear.\n","The doctor may also suggest stitches on the skin tear to close the skin. This may be an option if the skin tear is severe and is at risk of infection.[10] The doctor will use a local anesthesia on the area before they stitch it up.Your doctor will give you instructions about how to care for your stitches and when to return to have them removed.[11]Depending on where the wound is located, the stitches may need to stay in anywhere from a few days to 2 weeks.[12]\n","Get pain medication from the doctor if needed.\n","Skin tears can be sore and painful, especially if they are located on a sensitive spot on the body. Ask your doctor for prescription pain medication to help reduce the pain as the skin tear heals.[13]The doctor may also recommend over-the-counter pain medication you can get at your local drugstore, such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).\n","Moisturize your skin.\n","Apply lotion or another moisturizer to your skin, especially on your arms and legs. Skin that is dry tears much more easily than skin that is moisturized.[14]Drinking water also helps moisturize your skin, so be sure to consume an 8floz (240mL) glass of water 8 times each day.[15]\n","Eat a healthy, balanced diet to improve your skin condition.\n","The foods you eat can also affect your skin. Eat a variety of healthy foods so that you get all the vitamins and minerals you need to keep your skin in good condition. Avoid sugary, overly processed foods, such as candy, chips, cookies, or greasy fast food. Some good options include:[16]Lean proteins, such as poultry, beans, or tofuVegetables and fruitsWhole grain foods, such as brown rice or whole grain bread\n","Wear protective clothing, especially while you work.\n","If you do yard work or other activities that might put you at risk of scraping or bumping your skin, wear protective clothing to keep your skin safe. This can be as simple as wearing long sleeves and long pants.[17]If you work with your hands a lot, protect them with gloves or wrappings.Wrapped gauze or stockinette (tube-shaped) bandages can also protect vulnerable areas, like your ankles or knuckles.\n","Limit your sun exposure as much as possible.\n","The sun can dry out your skin and make it more prone to tears. To protect yourself, stay out of the sun as much as you can, especially during the middle of the day. If you have to go out, slather on a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and reapply it every 2 hours.[18]You can also protect your skin from the sun by wearing light, long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and broad-brimmed hats.\n","Avoid bathing frequently to prevent dry skin.\n","You might think that frequent soaks in the tub would be hydrating, but bathing too often can actually dry out your skin and make it more prone to tearing.[19] Keep your showers and baths short and avoid bathing more than once a day if possible.After you get out of the tub or shower, smooth on a gentle moisturizing lotion to lock in hydration and keep your skin from drying out.\n","Light your environment adequately.\n","Skin tears are often caused by bumping into your surroundings. Make sure your home or work has adequate light sources to avoid such accidents.[20]If you dont want to have lights on all the time, install motion-sensing nightlights around your home. For instance, you might put one of these lights in the hallway on the way to the bathroom to help you find your way in the dark.\n","Remove or pad objects that you might bump into.\n","If youre constantly bumping into furniture as you move around your home, youre a lot more likely to get skin tears. Make sure you have a clear path from one area to another, especially in spaces where you might be groping around in the dark (for example, on the way from your bedroom to your bathroom).[21]If you have a big item that you dont want to move, like a coffee table, try padding any sharp corners or edges with foam to prevent accidents.\n","5 Ways to Introduce Two Birds to Each Other - wikiHow\n","Quarantine a new bird for at least 30 days.\n","If you've gotten a new bird, you cannot place it in the same cage as your other birds immediately. The bird must first enter quarantine to ensure it isn't sick. Keep the new bird alone in a cage with food, water, toys, and other essentials. Put the cage in a separate room away from your other birds. If you notice any signs or symptoms of illness in the new bird, bring it to an avian vet immediately.You can work on taming this new bird during the quarantine period.To keep the all of your birds healthy during this time, always take care of the old bird before the new bird to prevent contamination.\n","House both birds in separate cages.\n","For a gradual introduction, you should keep the birds in different cages for at least 30 days. After the quarantine period, you can try placing the cages near each other, but if either bird seems stressed, place them at a greater distance.\n","Look for signs of stress.\n","If either bird experiences stress, you should try to minimize it.  Signs of stress include picking at feathers or skin, squawking or vocalizing loudly, and pecking or flapping its wings aggressively. If you see any behavioral or physical abnormalities, take the bird to the vet.\n","Make brief introductions in a neutral room.\n","In other words, if your bird lives in its cage in the living room, bring it into the basement or another room to meet its new friend for the first time.  Keep these initial introductions down to ten minutes or so.  Place the cages in the same room for about ten minutes or so, then remove them to their separate rooms.\n","Let the birds play in a common area when theyre comfortable.\n","Let both birds out of their cages in the common, neutral room and let them interact.  You could provide a playstand for the birds to hop and fly around on.\n","Always greet your original bird first.\n","When entering the room with the new and original bird, you should take both out of their cages for a short time so they can look around the neutral room and observe the other bird.  However, to ensure your original bird doesnt feel that its being supplanted, take it out first.  If you want to give your birds treats, give one to the original bird first, then give one to the new bird.\n","Remain present when introducing the birds.\n","Do not put two new birds together and leave the room, even if they are in separate cages.  This could cause undue stress for both birds.\n","Stay aware of potential problems.\n","Keep an eye out for conflict between the birds.  Biting, screaming, squawking, or other negative behaviors should be dealt with by placing both birds back in their cages for a time-out.  If your bird scratches or claws at its own feathers or skin, it might be appropriate to separate it from the other bird.\n","Do not expect the birds to act the same.\n","All birds have unique personalities and temperaments.[1]  Certain actions or sounds might trigger one bird but not the other.  For example, one bird might tire quickly of playing with another, and need to be put back in its own cage.  Stay conscious of differences in personality between the two different birds when deciding how to treat them.\n","Dont force a relationship.\n","Some birds get along great together.  Others take time but will eventually warm to one another.  Other birds will never get along well together.  Recognize when birds do not get along and respect their wishes by not placing them together.\n","Ensure your birds are of different genders.\n","Within a given species, larger birds are generally male and smaller birds are female.  If your birds are of the same size, or if you are unsure of your birds gender, consult a veterinarian.\n","Stay in the room with both birds when first introducing them to each other.\n","The first time you introduce the birds, you should plan on staying present with both for at least one day.  This applies whether you choose to put both birds together in one cage from the start or to introduce them to each other slowly.  Keep two bird nets and a pair of gloves on hand to prepare for the possibility that youll need to separate them.[2]\n","Gradually introduce the birds to each other.\n","[3]  Place the birds in two separate cages.  Hang the cages next to one another.  After a period of time, they will become comfortable with one another.  How long it takes them to become used to one another depends on the birds.  Since all birds are different, with unique personalities, likes, and dislikes, the rate at which they become comfortable with one another will vary.\n","Look for signs that either bird is stressed.\n","If your bird is stressed due to close proximity to another bird, it might pick its feathers or skin, lose weight or lose its appetite, drink and urinate excessively, peck people who handle it, squawk noisily, or pace back and forth on its perch. Look for these and other behavioral abnormalities particular to your bird in order to determine if it is stressed.  Introduce the mates to each other when their stress levels have subsided.If the birds show signs of stress, place the cages further apart from each other, rather than directly next to one another.\n","Put the birds together in a new cage.\n","If you do not want to introduce the birds to each other gradually, you can simply place them together in one cage as soon as the new bird has ended its quarantine period.  Place both birds in a flight cage which both are unfamiliar with.[4]  The confusion of being thrust into a new environment with another bird will eliminate the sense of territoriality which might accompany a bird being introduced to a cage which another bird already identified as its home.\n","Stop treating the birds as pets.\n","[5]  If you treating the birds as pets and show affection to one or both of them, they might become jealous of each other.  To ensure a harmonious mating, act in a disinterested way toward your birds.  Feed and water them regularly as before, but let their interactions replace the stimulation you would normally provide.Do not hand the birds treats directly.  If you want to give one or both of them treats, leave the treat on the floor or on a perch of the cage.Do interact with them in any way, including by talking to them or taking them out to teach them tricks.If other people in your household are also attached to the birds, they should stop seeing them as well.\n","Analyze your birds personality.\n","If you know your bird does not play well with other birds, do not introduce your bird to others.  One or the other of the birds could get hurt.  You could get hurt too if your bird is introduced to another while sitting on your arm or shoulder.\n","Tell your bird it will soon get a new friend.\n","Say to your bird in an enthusiastic tone, Soon you will get a new friend, or Are you excited to meet another bird?  You can tell your bird of the impending introduction a few days or a few hours before the introduction.  While birds might not understand English (or any other language), they will recognize when something big is about to happen.  Keeping your bird informed of situations that concern them is as important as it would be with any other member of your family.\n","Permit your bird to see your preparations.\n","Introducing two birds to each other often means introducing new equipment into the mix.  If you are moving a new cage into the house, for instance, let your bird see it.  You can draw your birds attention to the cage by commenting, This is where the new birds cage will be, or something along those lines.  You should let your bird see the new cage a few weeks before the new bird arrives.\n","Place a substitute in the new birds cage.\n","To help your bird understand that it will soon have a new friend, you should add a stand-in for the new bird to the new cage before the bird arrives.  For instance, you could place a stuffed animal on the perch in the cage, or lay a sock similar in color to the bird youll soon be introducing to your existing bird over the perch.\n","Minimize disruptions to your birds schedule and lifestyle wherever possible.\n","For instance, do not introduce a new bird to your bird during the time that your bird would normally be taking a bath or having a meal.  If you need to move your birds cage in order to make room for the new bird, do so well in advance of the new birds arrival.\n","Respect your original birds boundaries.\n","For instance, do not give your old birds cage to the new bird without repainting it or altering its appearance significantly.  If you do not, the bird that used to live in it will be jealous and could cause conflict.  Similarly, do not place a new birds cage right next to your original birds cage if it makes your original bird uncomfortable.\n","Dont overwhelm your bird with many new experiences.\n","For instance, if you decide to purchase a new cage for your original bird at the same time that you purchase a new bird (and cage), keep the new bird out of view until your original bird has acclimated to the new cage.  Depending on the bird, it may take a few days to a full week.\n","Identify birds which might need to be quarantined.\n","If introducing a new bird to your bird who has not received shots or been examined for potential illnesses, your bird could get sick.  Birds that have come from closed aviaries do not need to be quarantined.  Similarly, birds which have been check by a vet before leaving a reputable bird or pet shop do not need to be quarantined.  For all other birds, take them to a vet and follow your vets quarantine instructions in order to ensure the new bird does not introduce any illnesses to your original bird.\n","Take your new bird to the vet.\n","Find a vet who is familiar with avian illnesses and can provide directions on how long to quarantine your new bird.  Use the Association of Avian Veterinarians database (https://www.aav.org/search/custom.asp?id=1803) to find a bird vet near you.\n","Keep your new bird in quarantine.\n","Quarantine requires keeping a new bird whose health status you do not know away from a bird that you know to be healthy.  Quarantine periods last from 30 to 90 days, depending on the bird. Before introducing two birds to each other, ensure both have seen a vet recently.  If one has not, quarantine it in a separate cage and room.\n","How to Identify Charolais Cattle: 9 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Look for the classic coloring.\n","True French Charolais cattle are white, cream, or straw colored. The cattle's coloring is very distinctive and makes it easy to identify a Charolais.[1]Purebred Charolais cattle also have a white nose.Charolais are not the only breed of white cattle, so be sure to observe the cattle's other characteristics as well.\n","Be aware of other color variations.\n","In the United states, cattle can be considered purebred Charolais as long as 31/32 of their genetics are from Charolais cattle. This means that 1/32 can be from other breeds like Angus or Red Angus. As a result, it is possible for Charolais cattle to have red or black coloring, in addition to the traditional white or cream varieties.[2]Some Charolais cattle also develop a red coat due to a gene mutation.[3]In order to be registered with the American International Charolais Association as purebred, cattle must posses 31/32 Charolais genetics and be white, cream, straw, or red in color. This means black cattle are not eligible for the designation, even if they meet the genetic standards.Black and red Charolais may be more difficult to distinguish from other breeds of cattle because they lack one of the most distinctive features (the white color). For this reason, you may need to pay even more attention to the body composition and head characteristics than you would with a white Charolais.\n","Pay attention to the length of the coat.\n","Charolais cattle have an adaptable coat that helps them thrive in variable climates. In the winter, their coats are long and thick, but in the summer, they are short and sleek.\n","Consider size.\n","Charolais cattle are very broad and heavier than many other breeds. Cows weigh an average of 900 kg (1984 lbs), while bulls weigh an average of 1,100 kg (2425 lbs).In addition to being bulky, Charolais cattle are also rather tall. They have long legs compared to other breeds of cattle.[4]\n","Pay attention to the spine.\n","Charolais cattle have long, sturdy bodies. Pay attention to the length and straightness of the spine to help you decide if the cattle you are looking at are Charolais.Charolais cattle have straight backs that do not arch or round.[5]Charolais cattle also tend to have longer spines than many other breeds.\n","Look for muscular legs.\n","One of the main advantages to Charolais cattle is that they are extremely muscular. As you are observing cattle, pay particular attention to the muscle definition of the hindquarters, as this tends to be very defined in Charolais.You should notice a well-rounded second thigh on the bulls.[6]The loins and haunches are also very muscular.[7]Females have less muscular legs than males\n","Look for horns.\n","Charolais are naturally horned, but because many Charolais in the United States have been bred with other breeds, polled (hornless) Charolais are fairly common as well.[8]Purebred Angus cattle do not have horns, but those that have some Charolais genetics might.[9]\n","Look at the shape of the head.\n","Charolais cattle have wide muzzles and strong jaws. Like the rest of their bodies, their heads are large and powerful looking. [10]Charolais cattle also have very muscular necks that hold their heads proud.\n","Look at the eyes and ears.\n","Charolais cattle have large ears that stick out to the sides. Their eyes are set wide apart.[11]\n","How to Grow Ginseng (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Consider how you will market your ginseng.\n","Before you even start preparing to grow ginseng, make sure that you will have a way to sell it when it is mature. One option is to connect with a licensed ginseng dealer in your state. You may be able to visit their location with your ginseng, have it weighed, and get a price quote on the spot. If you dont like the price they give you, then you can simply try a different buyer.[1]You can check your states registry of licensed ginseng dealers to find one in your area. There may be several in your area that you can visit to find the best price for your product.If you want to cut out the middle man and sell and export ginseng yourself, then you might consider getting a dealer license. The rules for dealer licensing vary by state, so check to find out what your states regulations are. You will at least need to complete an application and pay a fee.[2]Some people also sell their ginseng on an auction site, such as eBay. However, you will still need to have an export license to do this.[3]\n","Understand the wild-simulated ginseng growing method.\n","This method mimics the plant's natural environment. While ginseng grown this way typically takes eight years to mature, the end result is much more valuable than field-cultivated ginseng due to its color and shape.[4] You may attempt to alter this process by using artificial shade or tilling the soil, but then you will be growing woods-grown ginseng, which may grow into a different, less valuable shape.[5]The field cultivation method results in a mature plant at 4 years, but requires intensive labor, greater risk of disease spreading, and roughly $20,000 to $40,000 per acre.[6] Most small scale farmers opt for the method described here instead, which results in a much more valuable plant and costs roughly $2,600 plus labor. Note that these costs are rough estimates.\n","Find out if you live in the right environment.\n","If you want to grow ginseng using the \"wild-simulated\" method, you'll need to have land within the plant's natural range. Ginseng grows in cool, temperate climates containing hardwood forests in areas of 20 to 40 inches of annual rainfall.[7] This type of environment is found in areas of the northwest, midwest, and northeast United States, southern Canada, and mountainous regions of the southern United States.[8]If you are not sure whether ginseng can be grown in your region, search online or contact your state or region's wildlife management department.\n","Obtain any necessary permits or licenses to grow and sell ginseng.\n","State regulations on growing ginseng vary, but you will often need special permits or licenses, especially if you are growing for commercial harvest. Research regulations for your area, and contact your local extension service or state agriculture or commerce departments to find out what you need to do to legally grow ginseng. You should also look into organic certification well before planting your seeds. The \"wild-simulated\" method as described here is organic.Of the 19 U.S. states that allow ginseng harvesting, 18 of them require any plants harvested to be at least 5 years old with 3 leaves, while Illinois requires the plants to be at least 10 years old with 4 leaves.\n","Select a suitable site.\n","Ginseng grows best in well-shaded sites (especially on north- or east-facing slopes) of moist hardwood forests, especially ones with deep-rooted, deciduous trees such as yellow poplar, oak, sugar maple, or tulip poplar. Mature forests with large hardwood trees and a canopy that blocks at least 75% of sunlight are ideal. Shrubs, briars, and other tall, thick undergrowth can compete with the ginseng and take up most of the available nutrients, leaving little for the ginseng.Probably the best way to determine if a site is appropriate is to look for wild ginseng growing there.Since wild ginseng is so rare, you can also get some idea of suitability if \"companion plants\" such as trillium, cohosh, jack-in-the-pulpit, wild yam, goldenseal, Solomons seal, wild ginger, or rattlesnake ferns are present.[9] Search for pictures of these online and check which grow in your area, or have a local botanist assist you.In addition, be aware that ginseng poachers are a serious problem: Be sure to choose a spot that is hidden from public view and not near a hiking trail or roadway.\n","Evaluate and test the soil.\n","The soil should be loamy and moist, yet able to drain quickly. Avoid swampy soil and hard clay. When you have a site in mind, take several soil samples of equal quantity from around the potential planting site and mix them together in a plastic bucket. Have a soil analysis performed at a state soil test laboratory or university.[10] Your garden supply store may have a kit that you can use yourself to test soil pH, but calcium and phosphorus tests are more difficult to perform on your own. While there is some controversy over what type of soil is best, qualities to look for include a pH of 4.5 to 5.5 (acidic soil), calcium levels of 3,000 to 5,000 pounds per acre (~0.35 kg per square meter), and phosphorus (P) levels of at least 95 pounds per acre (0.01 kg per square meter).Soil with the right level of moisture should not ball up in your hand or stick to your skin when you squeeze it.Some growers prefer a more neutral pH between 6 and 7. Unfortunately, there have not been enough definitive studies to determine the perfect environment for ginseng, but it should grow adequately in any pH range from 4 to 7.\n","Fertilize if necessary.\n","If you find a site that is perfect except for its soil chemistry, you may wish to amend the soil in the plot to adjust the pH or increase the quantities of phosphorus or calcium. If you want to sell wild-simulated ginseng instead of woods-cultivated, you must avoid fertilizer, or at least apply the fertilizer to the surface of the soil instead of mixing it in. The soil pH may be raised by adding lime (calcium carbonate), and calcium level can be increased--without altering pH--by the addition of gypsum (calcium sulfate).Note that ginseng is able to grow in areas with lower calcium or phosphate, but may produce smaller roots or grow more slowly. Consider spacing the plants further apart in these situations so plants aren't competing for the same nutrients.Also, be sure to test and amend the soil once every year\n","Purchase or harvest ginseng seeds.\n","Note that some regions have laws prohibiting or limiting the harvest of wild ginseng; look these up for your state, country, or region before searching for wild plants. If you are not legally allowed to pick them, or you cannot find the exceedingly rare wild plant, purchase seeds from a local grower or online. \"Green\" seeds will be cheaper than cold stratified seeds, but require a few months of preparation, described below.Soft, moldy, or discolored seeds are not suitable for planting. You may be able to return them to the seller for a replacement.Order seeds in advance in July or August, and have them delivered in the fall. Waiting until fall will likely leave you with the lowest quality seeds.\n","Keep seeds moist before planting.\n","Keep purchased, stratified seeds in the refrigerator in a plastic bag. Mist the seeds with a spray bottle once a week until you are ready to plant. If the seeds ever dry out, they will die.[11]\n","Prepare your seeds for sprouting if they are not stratified.\n","When a ginseng plant produces seeds in the wild, the seeds do not sprout the following year. To accomplish this, they require a year of stratification, a process in which the seeds lose the flesh of the berries that encase them and prepare to sprout. Most store-bought seeds are already stratified, but if you harvested them yourself or bought \"green\" seeds, you'll need to perform the process yourself. Depending on how many seeds you have, use one of the following methods:Place a small amount of seeds in a pouch made of lightweight mesh, tied with wire. In autumn, bury the pouch under 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13cm) of loose, shaded soil. Cover with several inches (~10cm) of mulch. Mark the location well and keep it moist, but not soaked.Place a large amount of seeds in a special container to drain water and keep out rodents. Construct a wooden box with a screen top and bottom, up to 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30cm) deep if you have enough seeds for several layers. Fill the box with alternating layers of moist sand and seeds. Bury the box with the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5cm) below the soil. Cover with mulch and mark the location. Water it if the soil dries out.\n","Plant sprouting seeds in the spring.\n","If you stratified your own seeds, dig up the container and see if any of the seeds are ready. Discard soft, moldy, or discolored seeds. If any seeds are sprouting, plant them immediately. Return the rest to the container and bury it again, stirring them around first and checking that the sand or soil is still moist.\n","Sow other seeds in the fall.\n","Most seeds should be sown in the autumn, after the leaves have fallen from the trees but before the ground freezes. Ginseng seeds will do best when sown in late fall or early winter, and planting should occur when the ground is moist, such as after a rain.\n","Soak seeds in bleach and water before planting.\n","Unless your seeds are sprouting, soak them in a mix of 1 part household bleach and 9 parts water.[12] Leave them in for 10 minutes to kill some of the fungus spores that often infect ginseng seeds. Seeds that float are most likely empty and dead, and should be discarded. Rinse the remaining seeds in clean water afterward and take them to your site to plant.You may also treat your seeds with a fungicide, but make sure it is safe for use on ginseng first.\n","Remove small weeds and ferns from the area.\n","It is not desirable to remove all plants from the area, but small underbrush will compete with the ginseng. Ferns in particular create a chemical that can kill nearby plants, so remove them or avoid areas adjacent to those plants.[13]\n","Plant large numbers of seeds quickly by scattering them.\n","If you want your ginseng to grow in the most wild conditions possible, or if you have a large quantity of seed, you may wish to simply scatter the seed on the selected planting site. Remove the leaf litter from the ground first. Aim to scatter about 6 to 12 seeds per square foot (65 to 120 seeds per square meter).\n","Plant smaller numbers of seeds more thoroughly.\n","Even most wild-simulated ginseng is planted with a little preparation and a couple standard gardening implements. First, rake leaves off the forest floor to expose the topsoil. Use a hoe to create furrows running up and down the slope. Plant according to needs:Plant the seeds 6 to 9 inches (15 to 23 cm) apart if you plan to harvest large, 7+ year old ginseng. This is a typical planting method for wild-simulated ginseng, as the wide spacing reduces the risk of disease spreading.Plant as little as 1 inch apart if you have a large number of seeds and want to harvest sooner.[14] This method is more commonly used for field-cultivated ginseng, since the densely planted ginseng must be carefully watched and treated for disease and pest control. It is not recommended for first time growers.\n","Cover the area with leaves or mulch.\n","Replace the leaf litter that you raked off, or add a layer of mulch. This keeps the ground moist, which is vital for ginseng. Use 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5cm) of ground cover but no more, since the ginseng sprouts will not be able to push through a thicker layer. You should use 4 inches (10cm) of mulch if you live in an area with cold winters and frequent frosts, but remember to reduce this to lower levels in the spring.[15]Do not use whole oak leaves. These are too tough and large for sprouts to grow through. Shred them first if you have already bought oak leaf mulch.\n","Mark the plot discreetly or locate it using a GPS device.\n","Youre not going to need to visit the site much, and the look of the forest can change a great deal over the 7+ years it takes for your plants reach maturity, so make sure you can find them again. The best way to do this is to use a GPS device to determine the exact coordinates of the plot. This way you dont leave any telltale signs that might invite poachers. If you must mark the plot, make sure your markers dont readily draw attention.\n","Keep the location secret and secure.\n","Because wild ginseng is so valuable, poachers are common in regions where it is grown. Fencing off the area won't deter someone who knows the ginseng is there, but it may prevent people from discovering the site.[16] A loud dog may be an excellent thief deterrent.\n","Thin densely growing ginseng each year.\n","Ginseng that grows too close together may spread disease between plants or compete with each other for nutrients. Consider removing or transplanting plants after the first growing season to get down to 6 plants per square foot (65 per square meter), and again after the second year of growth down to 1 or 2 plants per square foot (11 to 22 per square meter). You may also plant ginseng in other areas each year during the fall to develop an ongoing harvest. Many growers do this so they have mature ginseng to harvest each year after the first batch matures.\n","Research carefully before using pesticides and pest poison.\n","One major advantage to the wild-simulated method is a reduced risk of pest and disease, due to the wider spacing. While a few plants or berries may be eaten occasionally, you are unlikely to lose many of the valuable roots, and diseases shouldn't spread between plants at a high rate.[17] If you do encounter a problem, contact your local wildlife department for information about ginseng pesticides.Keep in mind that you may lose your organic certification or your credibility in selling wild-simulated ginseng if you use pesticides.\n","Wait for the plants to mature.\n","You'll need to wait about 7 to 10 years for your plants to mature into large, valuable roots, but with the right site and a little luck. Growing ginseng with the wild-simulated method requires a lot of patience, but almost no maintenance. Check periodically to see if the ground remains moist and covered with a small amount of leaf litter.If your ginseng is planted densely, harvest after 4 years or the roots might begin to dwindle These roots will not be as valuable, however.\n","Don't expect the plants to stay visible year round.\n","The part of the ginseng plants above the surface will die back in the autumn, but grow again in the spring. It will grow bigger each time, and all the while, the root below will be growing larger.\n","Harvest red berries annually after the third year.\n","Once the plants have matured, they will produce a cluster of red berries with the seed in the center. Pick these in the fall if you want to harvest the seeds for planting or selling. Keep in mind they will need to be stratified as described under Preparing the Seeds.\n","Harvest mature plants at any point past the seventh year.\n","Given how long it takes ginseng to reach maturity, youll probably want to harvest your plants as soon as you can, which is typically 7 years for a high quality root. If youre not in any hurry you can leave them in the ground for many more years and they will continue to grow. If you are in a hurry, check local laws for regulations on how early you can harvest ginseng.\n","Dig carefully so as not to damage the root.\n","Use a pitchfork or needle-nose spade to dig under the plant, and leave plenty of space (about 6 inches or 15 cm) between the plant and where you push the pitchfork or spade into the ground. If the plant is close to immature ginseng plants, use a smaller implement such as a stout flat blade screwdriver about 8 or 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) long, and work with extra care. If there is any risk of damaging the roots of adjacent immature ginseng plants, do not attempt to harvest the plant until the other plants mature.Note: Ginseng plants typically grow at a 45 angle into the soil, not straight down, and will fork into several sections. Dig carefully and make sure you don't break the root.[18]\n","Wash and dry the roots.\n","Briefly soak the roots in a bucket of cool water to remove excess soil. Then place the roots in a single layer on a wooden tray and wash them gently under a sink faucet or with a hose. Make sure the roots are not touching and let them dry on a wooden rack in a well-ventilated room with a temperature between 70 and 90F (2132C). Humidity should remain between 35 and 45% to prevent drying the plant too quickly and reducing its value. Turn the plants once per day. The roots are ready when you are able to snap them, but you should only do this on a single test root now and then.Do not scrub the roots or wash them too vigorouslysome of the medicinal chemicals are concentrated in the root hairs, and removal of these hairs will decrease the usefulness and value of the root.Small roots take a day or two to dry, but large, mature roots may take up to six weeks.[19]Direct sunlight usually dries the roots too fast, but if you see any mold or discoloration growing, put them in direct sun for a few hours to kill the infection.\n","Leo Sexual Compatibility: Most & Least Compatible Signs\n","Sparks fly instantly between Leo and Aries.\n","Their sexual preferences line up almost perfectly; they're both energetic, bold, and adventurous in the bedroom.

Leo may need more romance than Sagittarius is used to in the bedroom, but easygoing Sagittarius is happy to adjust sometimes.Sagittarius and Leo are 4 signs apart on the zodiac and form a trine, so they have red-hot sexual compatibility with one another.If Leo goes all out in the bedroom (which they're usually inclined to do anyway), they can make sure Sagittarius keeps coming back for more.\n","Libra and Leo both live for romance and drama during intimacy.\n","This pair will pull out all the stops: wine, flowers, candles, and more. Libra's passive energy may put Leo off at first, but once they start getting close, Leo can discover the true warmth and passion of a Libra native. Underneath their detached exterior, Libra is an energetic lover who will love Leo's naturally affectionate nature.Leo and Libra are also sextile signs, so they'll feel a strong and immediate connection to one another.Libra is also ruled by Venus, the planet of love and pleasure. This sign loves to flirt, and Leo is a natural flirt too. Leo will eagerly match Libra's energy and quickly turn up the heat between them.\n","Two Leos may appreciate each other but get competitive in the bedroom.\n","Because two Leos will generally have the same standards and expectations of their sex life, they'll be able to fulfill one another's needs very well. However, Leo can also be a little selfish during intimacy and wants to be the center of attentionso two Leos might get into a power struggle at times.Two Leos form a conjunct, meaning they're the same sign. In astrology, a conjunct can be good for compatibility, as matching signs will create a powerful bond with one another.Leo partners can enjoy a satisfying sex life if they learn to share the spotlight and give one another the royal treatment they deserve.\n","Leo and Taurus have sexual chemistry despite their different values.\n","Taurus wants comfort and stability while Leo wants excitement, leading to some clashes in their intimacy. However, Taurus is ruled by Venus, so this sign has a huge soft spot for all the affection that Leo can give them. They also share a love of the finer things that can make intimacy between these signs feel sensual and luxurious.Leo and Taurus are 3 signs apart on the zodiac wheel, forming a square angle. In astrology, this means there may be tension between the two signs.Slow-moving Taurus often matches best with a partner whose drive and passion can keep the relationship moving. Leo is ideally suited to do just that!Leo and Taurus are incredibly stubborn, which can backfire in the bedroom. Leo wants to be in charge, but Taurus refuses to be bossed around. This couple will need to compromise to find stability![3]\n","Virgo's primal side blends well with Leo's sexual preferences.\n","Virgo is usually more cautious and reserved than passionate Leo but can come out of their shell in the bedroom. Virgo is also supportive and loves to be of service, which is appealing to Leo. Though Virgo can nitpick, Leo's impeccable grooming and hygiene will turn Virgo on and appease their inner perfectionist.[4]Leo and Virgo are semisextile, or 1 sign apart on the zodiac wheel. Semisextile signs in astrology tend to have very different qualities, leading to friction between them.Leo may not recognize Virgo's desire for emotional support during intimacy and may have to adjust their style to make Virgo more comfortable. Leo should listen to Virgo's needs and make them feel heard.\n","Scorpio and Leo can have an explosive sex lifeintense but volatile.\n","While Scorpio has enough sexual passion to match Leo, they have emotional differences that can cause friction. Leo wants to be pampered during intimacy, while Scorpio's wild side makes them a little rough for Leo's taste. At the same time, Leo and Scorpio might be more attracted to one another because of their differences.Leo and Scorpio are 3 signs apart on the zodiac wheel, forming a square aspect. This suggests they may be prone to power struggles during intimacy.Scorpio and Leo are both fixed signs, which works well for them in the bedroom.

However, Leo can help Cancer try new things and explore their sexual side a little more, while Cancer can use their nurturing and attentive nature to make Leo feel adored during intimacy.Cancer and Leo are next to each other on the zodiac and, therefore, semisextile. They won't have much in common, which leads to tension between them.Though they show emotions differently, both Leo and Cancer want sex to be an emotional experience. Their intimacy will be intensely satisfying if Leo is sensitive to Cancer's feelings and if Cancer lets Leo take the lead and be creative.\n","Leo and Pisces may struggle to understand each other.\n","Both signs love romance, but Pisces may have expectations that Leo finds unrealistic, while Leo's directness can cause an elusive Pisces to retreat. However, sex between a Leo and Pisces can also be sensual and passionate; both have strong imaginations and love to indulge in roleplay.Leo and Pisces form a quincunx aspect, meaning they're 5 signs apart on the zodiac. This awkward aspect predicts discord between the two signs, although they can work together if they both make adjustments.To have a fulfilling sex life, Leo and Pisces may actually need to put off intimacy for a while and work on building emotional trust first. Once they're comfortable with one another, they can have the physical closeness that they crave.\n","Capricorn and Leo must work hard to have a happy sex life.\n","Leo is warm and enthusiastic, whereas Capricorn is practical, and they'll have trouble overcoming their perceived differences.

It's easy to assume this sign would be boring in bed, but Capricorn can be adventurous and energetic!\n","How to Write Shorthand (Teeline, Pitman, or Gregg)\n","Memorize the Teeline shorthand alphabet.\n","The Teeline alphabet is based on the letters of the English alphabet that you're already familiar with. This makes it a little quicker and easier to pick up than the other shorthand systems. Most of the letters are a small fraction of the corresponding English letters.[1]For example, the top point of the letter \"A\" is the symbol for that letter in Teeline.\n","Keep only the essential vowels and consonants in words.\n","Leave out silent vowels and consonants, double vowels and consonants, and any other letters that are unnecessary for you to understand the word you've written. There are some conventional representations of words, but for the most part, this is up to you! As long as you can read it, that's all that matters. Get in the habit of recognizing words this way when writing in English and it will make your shorthand practice a lot easier.[2]For example, if you were writing the word \"lamb,\" you would only write \"lm\" in Teeline. The word \"comma\" would be \"cma,\" \"about\" would be \"abt,\" and \"light\" would simply be \"lt.\"For a full sentence in Teeline, such as, \"You should always remember to take notes in class,\" you would only include the letters, \"U shld alwys rmbr t tk nts in cls.For the most part, Teeline is based on the alphabetical spelling of a word, not how it sounds, but there are some exceptions. For example, consonant blends such as \"gh\" or \"ph\" can be reduced to the symbol for \"f.\"\n","Write vowels smaller than consonants.\n","In Teeline shorthand, vowels are a bit smaller than consonants so it's easy to distinguish them from similarly shaped consonants. Each vowel has a full vowel symbol, which usually stands in for a specific word. There's also a \"vowel indicator,\" an even smaller symbol that you'll typically use to indicate the vowel in words.[3]For example, the letter \"A\" standing alone stands for \"able to\" or \"ability.\" You should be able to figure out from the context which word you meant.Vowel indicators are particularly handy for words that start or end with a vowel because all you need is a small mark, not the full symbol for the letter itself.\n","Join consonants together.\n","Write consonants in 1 or 2 strokes without lifting your pen. Keep the first letter clear, then add the next letter to form a single symbol. Sometimes, whole words can be written with a single symbol by joining consonants. This makes your shorthand much faster.[4]For example, you could join \"b\" and \"d\" by starting with the symbol for \"b,\" then adding a horizontal line on the \"b\" for the \"d.\"Try a searchable Teeline dictionary to figure out how to write specific words with consonants joined together.\n","Memorize the Pitman phonetic symbols.\n","Pitman phonetic symbols are based on the sounds that form words, rather than the specific letters of the alphabet you use to write them. Variations in the thickness of the strokes differentiate sounds, most of which are written with a single line or slash. There are separate sets of symbols for consonant sounds and vowel sounds.[5]Because this method uses phonetics, a sound that might be written with different letters would use the same symbol in the Pitman shorthand notation. For example, the \"f\" sound in the words \"form,\" \"elephant,\" and \"rough\" would all use the same symbol.\n","Adjust the thickness of your stroke depending on the consonant.\n","Generally, voiced consonants (those where you can feel the vibration of your vocal cords when you say them) have thicker strokes, while unvoiced consonants have thinner strokes. This is in keeping with the phonetic focus of Pitman shorthand.[6]For example, the vertical line for the unvoiced consonant \"t\" is thinner than the vertical line for the voiced consonant \"d.\"The left slanted line for the unvoiced consonant \"p\" is thinner than the left slanted line for the voiced consonant \"b.\"\n","Use diacritical marks to represent vowels where necessary.\n","Diacritical marks are dots and dashes applied around the consonant sound symbols. These marks indicate the vowel sound used for that syllable. Your shorthand reflects the way the word sounds, not its actual spelling.[7]For example, you'd write \"bat\" by placing the \"t\" symbol under the \"b\" symbol, then add a dot for the \"a\" at the top of the left-hand slant of the \"b.\"\n","Speed up your writing with abbreviations for common words.\n","Frequently used words, such as \"a,\" \"the,\" \"of,\" and \"to,\" have their own single symbol abbreviations that make your writing even faster. Many of these abbreviations are common words used in any field, but there are also industry-specific abbreviations depending on where you're using Pitman shorthand.[8]For example, if you use Pitman shorthand in the legal field, you'd want to learn abbreviations for common legal terms, such as \"plaintiff,\" \"defendant,\" \"judge,\" \"witness,\" and \"court.\"The Long Live Pitman's Shorthand website has an excellent resource with printable drill workbooks as well as lists of vocabulary, contractions, and short forms.\n","Memorize the Gregg phonetic symbols.\n","Gregg symbols are phonetic, with separate symbols for vowel sounds and consonant sounds. Most of the Gregg symbols are hooks, lines, or circles. Like other shorthand systems, these symbols are connected together to form words so you can write even faster.[9]\n","Write hooks and lines for each consonant sound.\n","Gregg Shorthand uses a hook of a different shape or length to represent most consonant sounds. Some consonant sounds, such as \"n\" and \"m,\" are straight horizontal lines. Other consonant sounds, such as \"f\" and \"v,\" are more vertical and curved. Practice the symbol for each consonant sound multiple times so you can commit it to memory.[10]The Gregg system also has individual symbols that represent common consonant clusters, such as the \"nd\" in the word \"and.\"\n","Use circles of different sizes to represent vowel sounds.\n","The circle you use depends on the vowel sound, not necessarily the specific vowel in the written word, so be careful! As a phonetic system, Gregg relates the sound, not the specific spelling. So the same vowel symbol would be used for both the \"ee\" in \"feet\" and the \"i\" in \"elite.\"[11]As with consonants, there are circle combinations that represent vowel clusters or diphthongs. For example, the vowel sound \"oo\" is represented by an open circle at the bottom of the word, while the vowel sound \"ea\" is represented by a circle with a dot in the center.\n","Include appropriate punctuation marks.\n","Unlike other shorthand systems, Gregg shorthand includes symbols for periods, question marks, and hyphens. The symbol for the punctuation mark goes just above the bottom line.[12]For example, a small dash represents a period while a small \"x\" represents a question mark.\n","Use a pen with a nib for Pitman shorthand.\n","A pen with a flexible nib allows you to vary the thickness of your strokes more quickly and easily. Since Pitman shorthand relies on strokes of different thicknesses to differentiate letters, this type of pen will help you write Pitman shorthand more quickly.[13]Gregg and Teeline, on the other hand, don't require any variation in the thickness of strokes, so any sort of pen is finejust make sure it glides smoothly across the page so you can write as quickly as possible.\n","Take an online course in writing shorthand.\n","An online course is the easiest way to learn shorthand. Some of these courses are even free! Since online learning is usually self-pacing, you can learn at your own speed and take time with parts that you don't get as easily.[14]Try Shorthandly if you want to get started in Gregg or Pitman. They offer free courses through YouTube videos as well as some practice resources on the site.Teeline Online offers lots of free Teeline resources, including downloadable worksheets and outlines you can use.If you do better one-on-one, search locally for a veteran shorthand writer who's willing to tutor you. Local court reporter companies are good places to find shorthand writers.\n","Practice your shorthand regularly to get faster at it.\n","When you first get started, you'll be able to write pretty fastbut you'll quickly plateau, typically at around 80 words per minute. To get even faster, practice as often as you can, and don't be afraid to make mistakes![15]Use flashcards to quickly memorize specific symbols and outlines of words you use frequently. That'll definitely improve your speed.Keep a small notebook with you so you can practice your shorthand. For example, you might write your grocery list using shorthand or take notes during a meeting or a phone call.\n","11 Ways to Say Cute in Spanish - wikiHow\n","This classic adjective lets someone know theyre looking good.\n","Lindo directly translates to cute, making it the perfect option for some casual flirting.

Try a duffel bag, laundry sack, or even a purse or briefcase.[1]\n","Make sure your bag has pockets.\n","A detective needs to be able to grab their tools quickly, without rummaging around. Your bag should have pockets, compartments, or some other way of organizing your things. If you cant get a bag with pockets, try putting your things into smaller bags, like makeup or sandwich bags. Then, you can put the small bags into the larger one.[2]\n","Choose some backup bags for special missions.\n","If youre undercover as a hula dancer in Hawaii, carrying a briefcase will ruin your disguise! Its a good idea to have a few extra bags as backup for undercover work. Try adding a beach bag, a purse, or even a paper grocery bag to your kit.[3]\n","Choose your regular detective gear.\n","Every detective has a uniform that they wear every time they're on the job, except when they're undercover.

These jealous feelings stem from fear that their partner may form a deep or romantic connection with their friend.[2]\n","Sexual tension between friends\n","Oftentimes, people worry that a friendship between a man and a woman will have an undercurrent of sexual tension throughout it. While this isnt true for all friendships between men and women, media like When Harry Met Sally and other rom-coms of its nature have helped solidify the myth that male-female friendships cant ever be purely platonic.However, the opposite is often true. Many people in platonic friendships with the opposite sex report that their friend feels like a sibling, and that they would never even consider sleeping with them.[3]If youre worried that your friend might get the wrong idea, have a conversation with them. Make sure youre both on the same page and that neither of you wants to pursue a romantic relationship, either now or in the future.Say something like, I just want to make it clear that were just friends, okay? I dont want to make my partner uncomfortable, so Id like this to be a completely platonic relationship.\n","Studies tell us that men are more attracted to their female friends than vice versa.\n","In 2012, researchers released a study that did a deep dive into the platonic nature of friendships between men and women. The scientists found that while it was possible to have male-female friendships, men were slightly more likely to be attracted to their female friends than women are attracted to their male friends.[4]The same study also reported that men were less likely to respect the relationship status of their female friends (meaning theyd still consider sleeping with their female friends even if those friends are in a relationship).\n","Set ground rules with your partner.\n","If youre feeling nervous about your partner having friends of the opposite sex, talk about it. Let them know what youre comfortable with and what youre not comfortable with to enforce your boundaries. Then, have your partner do the same for you. You might establish rules like:[5]Never prioritize your friendships over your partner.Never hide any activity or communication with your friends from your partner.Never flirt with your friend, even when your partner isnt around.Never call your partner jealous or crazy for expressing their concerns.\n","Treat your opposite-sex friend like you would any other friend.\n","This is the key to making a male-female friendship work. If you notice that youre treating your opposite-sex friend differently in any way, its likely that youre crossing a boundary that your partner wouldnt be comfortable with. Keep this in mind as you interact with your friend to avoid any jealousy issues.[6]Grab a beer, get a cup of coffee together, or watch a movie. Do normal friend things without flirting or complimenting your friend about their physical appearance.If youre not sure, try asking yourself, Would my partner be upset if they saw this message or behavior right now? If the answer is yes, you are crossing a boundary.\n","Check in with your partner often.\n","Communication with your partner is key. In heterosexual relationships, its normal for your partner to feel a little awkward about your opposite-sex friend. The more you can do to hear them out and make them feel okay about it, the better. Always listen to their concerns, and do your best to make your partner feel comfortable whenever youre with your friend.[7]\n","How to Have Healthy, Shiny Silky Hair: 15 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Handle your hair gently when you wash and dry it.\n","The way you handle your hair makes a big difference in its texture and appearance. When you're rough with your hair, it can frizz up and start looking dull.[1] Hair is a fragile material that should be handled with care, just like a delicate piece of fabric. Here's what to keep in mind:When you shampoo your hair don't roughly scrub it. Massage the shampoo into your hair and distribute it with your fingers.Rinse your conditioner in the coldest water you can stand. The cold temperature seals the cuticle and helps your hair look shiny, while hot water will cause it to frizz up and look dull.Gently squeeze the water from your hair and pat it dry with a towel instead of twisting and wringing it out.[2]\n","Shampoo just a few times a week.\n","Shampooing your hair every single day causes it to dry out and become brittle.[3] The natural oil your scalp produces to nourish your hair gets rinsed away before it can do its job. If you want your hair to stay healthy and shiny, you only really need to wash it once or twice a week, depending on your hair type.[4]When you first cut back on how often you wash your hair, you may notice it looking oilier than normal. Your scalp is producing oil on overdrive since it's used to everyday washings. After a week or two things will balance out and your hair will look cleaner, longer.On days in between washings, when you need to perk up your hair,  try dry shampoo. It's a powder you sprinkle, or an aerosol you spray, on your hair to absorb the oil, and it works like a charm.\n","Let your hair air dry instead of using heat.\n","The best way to keep your hair healthy is to let it dry naturally instead of using a hair dryer. The heat from the hair dryer damages the hair shaft, and if you do it every day you'll definitely see damage over time.[5] Put that hair dryer away and let your hair dry the natural way.The same goes for other heat styling tools, like curling irons, straightening irons, and hot rollers.On days when you do want to use a hair dryer or other styling tools, apply a heat protectant serum to your hair so it doesn't get quite as damaged.\n","Comb your hair instead of brushing it.\n","Running a plastic-bristled brush through your hair, especially when it's wet, is almost guaranteed to cause some damage. Brushing tends to rip your hair, while combing removes the tangles without pulling it out. Use a wide-tooth comb and work out the tangles starting close to the tips and moving up to the roots.\n","Don't use damaging treatments.\n","Dyeing, bleaching, chemically straightening, and chemically curling your hair all damage the shaft. For the healthiest possible hair, it's best to stop these treatments and let your hair take on its natural color and texture. Your hair might not be the exact color you want, but it will be healthy, shiny and silky.If you do want to dye your hair, look into henna, honey, or tea dyeing. These natural dyes actually restore shine to your hair, rather than damaging it. You won't be able to achieve a dramatic color change, but you can go a few shades lighter or darker.\n","Avoid restrictive hairstyles that pull out hair.\n","Waves, wefts, dreads, and other styles that require permanently pulling your hair into a tight position can cause damage and hair loss. While some types of weaves are less damaging than others (sewn weaves are usually better than glue-ins, for example) your hair will be healthier if you forego them altogether.\n","Condition your hair each time you shampoo.\n","Use just enough conditioner to coat the strands of your hair without completely weighing it down. Apply the conditioner an inch or so from your roots and use a wide-toothed comb to comb it down to the tips. Rinse the conditioner with cool water for a shiny finish.If your hair tends to get very dry, try using a leave-in conditioner as well. Apply the conditioner after you get out of the shower, while your hair is still damp. It will keep your hair soft and supple until your next shampoo.\n","Do deep conditioning treatments every few weeks.\n","Deep conditioning treatments are a great way to make your hair look silkier and shinier. Since the treatments are so effective, you only need to do them once every week or two. Use a store-bought deep conditioner or a household oil like coconut oil, olive oil, or almond oil. Complete the treatment as follows:Dampen your hair and apply about a tablespoon of the deep conditioner. Use a wide-toothed comb to distribute it throughout your hair.Put your hair in a high bun or ponytail at the top of your head. Cover with a shower cap or plastic wrap.Leave the conditioner in for at least an hour and up to eight hours.Shampoo your hair as normal to remove excess conditioner.\n","Try a homemade hair mask.\n","On days when you don't have time for a deep conditioning treatment but you want to give your hair an extra lift, try using a household product to enhance your hair's texture and appearance. After you wet your hair in the shower, apply a hair mask. Shampoo it out at the end of your shower. Here are homemade masks that make hair shiny and silky:One tablespoon of honey or one egg whiteOne blended banana or avocadoOne tablespoon of milk or yogurtA combination of any of the above ingredients\n","Use finishing oil or serum to add shine.\n","If your hair tends to get frizzy and dull, hair oil or serum will smooth it down and protect it from the elements during the day.[6] Put a few drops on your fingertips and run the serum through your hair, focusing on the tips. Look for hair serum or oil that contains one of the following nourishing ingredients:[7]Argan oilMoroccan oilJojoba oil\n","Try a boar bristle brush.\n","Most brushes are unhealthy for hair, but boar bristle brushes are specially designed to make your hair shiny and smooth. The bristles are the same texture as human hair, and they pull your hair's natural oil from the roots to the tips for a nourishing conditioning treatment. These brushes also stimulate the scalp, which promotes hair growth.The night or morning before you plan to shampoo your hair, use a wide-tooth comb to remove tangles.Brush your hair with a boar bristle brush for about 10 minutes to distribute the oils.Wait at least an hour before shampooing.\n","Be healthy from the inside out.\n","Your diet and other health habits have a big effect on the texture of your hair.

When you're dehydrated, your hair can end up getting dry and brittle.Avoid smoking cigarettes. Smoke damage can make hair look dull and dried out.\n","Use natural hair products.\n","Ingredients in your shampoo and conditioner may be making your hair look dry and dull instead of silky and shiny. Switch to all-natural shampoos and conditioners that nourish your hair instead of stripping its gleam and weighing it down. Here's what to use:[8]Choose sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfates are harsh cleansers used in everything from dish soap to laundry detergent, and people are starting to realize they're not very good for hair. Look for shampoos that say \"sulfate-free\" and are made with natural cleansers.Sulfate-free shampoos are also good for those with curly and wavy hair, because they help prevent frizz.Choose a silicone-free conditioner. Silicons are added to conditioner because they make hair look shiny and smooth after the first few applications. Unfortunately, over time they build up in your hair and cause it to look weighed-down and dull. You're better off with silicone-free options.\n","Massage your scalp to promote hair growth.\n","Besides feeling great, massage promotes good circulation in the scalp, which helps your hair grow faster and stronger. Do a scalp massage every day, or at least every time you take a shower. Just place your fingers on your scalp and rub it using a gentle circular motion.To enhance your massage, try using coconut oil, almond oil, or jojoba oil. This is especially beneficial if you're worried about thinning hair.Tea tree oil, lavender oil or cedar wood oil are also healthy for hair.\n","Get regular trims.\n","Trim off your split ends regularly to keep your hair in the best of health. Getting regular trims will also make your hair look shinier in appearance, since you're removing the dull, damaged parts. Choose a cut that brings out the best in your hair, and get your locks trimmed every 6-8 weeks.\n","3 Ways to Stop a Nose Bleed - wikiHow\n","Position your body.\n","If you do not have a serious issue that led to your nose bleed, you can perform some first aid at home during a nose bleed to help stop it. To begin, sit down, since it is more comfortable than standing. Tilt head forward so that the blood drains through the nostrils.A towel can be held under your nose to collect the blood.Do not lie down as this can cause blood to pass down the throat.\n","Compress the nose.\n","With a finger and thumb, pinch the lower fleshy end of the nose, completely blocking the nostrils. Pinching at this point directly applies pressure at the region where the blood vessels are damaged. This makes the move more effective since it will help stop the flow of blood. Keep pinching the nose for 10 minutes, then release.If bleeding continues, reapply pressure for another 10 minutes.While you do this, breathe through the mouth.\n","Cool yourself down.\n","Lowering your body temperature can help reduce the blood flow to your nose. To do this, place ice cubes in your mouth. This helps achieve a lower temperature sooner than cooling the external part of the nose. It also will help you retain the lower temperature for longer.This is more effective than placing a cold compress over the nose. Cold compresses placed over the nose are not very effective according to a recent clinical study.You can also suck on a popsicle to achieve the same result.[2]\n","Use oxymetazoline nasal sprays.\n","While you have a nose bleed but not on a regular basis, you can try a medicated nose spray if you do not have high blood pressure issues. This medication causes constriction of the blood vessels in your nose. To use, take a small clean cotton ball or gauze piece, add 1-2 drops of the spray to it, insert them into the nostrils, continue pinching the nostrils, and check for bleeding after 10 minutes.If bleeding has stopped, do not remove the cotton or gauze for about an hour, because bleeding can reoccur.Frequent use of this drug, which is more than 3-4 days at a time, can cause addiction and nasal congestion.These sprays are used only if bleeding does not stop on pinching the nose after the first 10 minutes.\n","Wash your nose and rest.\n","After bleeding has stopped, you can clean the area around your nose with warm water. After you have cleaned your face, you should rest for a while. This is to help to prevent further bleeding.You can lie down while resting.\n","Be gentle on your nose.\n","Since nose bleeds can be caused by personal actions, there are some preventative methods that will help you prevent nose bleeds in the future. You should avoid picking your nose. Picking can cause an injury to the inner sensitive blood vessels of the nose. It can also detach the blood clots covering previously injured blood vessels and cause further bleeding. You should also keep your mouth open while sneezing to prevent the expulsion of air through the nose.You should keep the inner lining of your nose moist by gently applying a coating of petroleum jelly or nasal gel inside your nose with a cotton swab twice a day.[3]Always blow your nose gently and do it one side at a time.You should also clip the fingernails of children to avoid further injury.\n","Buy a humidifier.\n","To increase the humidity in your environment, you should buy a humidifier. You can use a humidifier at home or work to prevent excessive dryness, especially in the wintertime.If you do not have a humidifier, a metal container with water can be placed on top of heating radiators to humidify the air.\n","Increase your fiber intake.\n","Constipation can lead to bearing down to pass hard stool, which causes an increase in nose bleeds because it strains your blood vessels. This can increase arterial pressure momentarily and dislodge blood clots covering previously injured blood vessels, which can eventually result in further nose bleeds. Constipation can be prevented by eating foods high in fiber and increasing your fluid intake.\n","Eat fiber to keep stools soft.\n","Do not bear down during bowel movements, since this increases the intra-cerebral arterial pressure thereby increasing the chance of small sensitive blood vessel rupture in the nose[4]Eating 6 to 12 prunes a day are more effective than dietary fibers and can be used to prevent constipation.[5]You should also avoid hot and spicy foods. Heat can dilate blood vessels and precipitate bleeding.\n","Use saline nasal sprays.\n","Saline nose sprays can be used several times each day to keep the nose moist.[6] These nasal sprays are not as addictive as they only contain salt. If you don't want to buy them, you can make your own.To make your own, take a clean container. Mix 3 heaping teaspoons of iodide-free salt and 1 rounded teaspoon of baking soda. Mix both the powders together. Then take 1 teaspoon of the powdered mixture and add it to 8 ounces of lukewarm distilled or boiled water. Mix well.[7]\n","Eat more flavonoids.\n","Flavonoids, which are a group of natural chemical compounds present in citrus fruits, can improve fragility of blood capillaries.[8] Because of this, you should consider increasing your consumption of citrus fruits. Other foods with a high flavonoid content include parsley, onions, blueberries and other berries, black tea, green tea and oolong tea, bananas, all citrus fruits, Ginkgo biloba, red wine, sea-buckthorns, and dark chocolate (with a cocoa content of 70% or greater).You should not take flavonoid supplements, such as ginkgo pills, quercetin tablets, grape seed extract, and flaxseed, because they result in a higher flavonoid content and eventual toxicity.[9]\n","Learn the types of nose bleeds.\n","The types of nose bleeds rely on which part of the nose the bleeding comes from. In anterior nose bleeds, bleeding arises in the front part of the nose. You can also have a posterior nose bleeds, where bleeding originates in the inner part of the nose. Nose bleeds can also be spontaneous with an unidentifiable cause.[10]\n","Know the causes.\n","There are many causes for nose bleeds. When you get one, you should assess which of the causes is most likely the reason you got your nose bleed and avoid the situation if at all possible in the future. You can get a nose bleed because of self-induced trauma, mostly as a result of nasal picking. This is the most common cause in young children. Other causes include substance abuse of drugs such as cocaine, blood vessel disorders, blood clotting disorders, and trauma to the head or face.Environmental factors such as low humidity, which is common during the winter, can induce mucosal irritation and bleeding. The incidence of nasal bleeding increases in colder weather.Infections of the nose and sinuses can cause a nose bleed. Allergies can also cause mucosal inflammation, which leads to nose bleeds.In some special cases, migraine headaches in children have also been proposed as a causative.[11]Trauma to the face can also cause a nose bleed to occur.\n","Avoid certain situations.\n","If you get a nose bleed, you should avoid certain situations and actions which may make it worse. Do not lean backwards. This may cause blood to run down your throat, which could induce vomiting. You should also avoid speaking and coughing. This can irritate the nasal mucosa and re-bleeding can occur.If you have to sneeze while your nose is bleeding, you should try to expel the air through your mouth so you don't further hurt your nose or cause more bleeding.Do not blow or pick the nose, especially if the bleeding is decreasing. You can dislodge formed blood clots and bleeding can reoccur.\n","Visit the doctor.\n","There are certain situations when you need to visit a doctor. If the bleeding is severe, more than a few drops, lasts more than 30 minutes, and reoccurs frequently, you should see a doctor. You also need to seek medical attention if you become extremely pale, fatigued, or disoriented. This can occur as a result of significant blood loss.If you have difficulty breathing, especially if blood passes down your throat, you need to see a doctor. This can lead to irritation and coughing. There is a chance of infection as a result, which can eventually cause breathing issues.You should always see a doctor if the nose bleed began as a result of severe injury to the nose.You should also see a doctor if you have a nose bleed while you are taking medicine that prevents blood clotting, such as warfarin, clopidogrel, or a daily aspirin.\n","3 Ways to Kick an Excedrin Addiction - wikiHow\n","Note telltale signs.\n","Most people start taking Excedrin to control headaches. But you can develop a dependency very quickly. What happens is that Excedrin shuts off pain receptors in your brain, and these receptors become more sensitive the more you use the drug. This means that you get rebound headaches without the drug.[1]You can develop a dependence on Excedrin by using it as little as 15 days a month.Excedrin also contains about as much caffeine as coffee. So, with regular use, you can develop a caffeine addiction, as well.[2] You may, therefore, have two addictions: one to Excedrin as a pain reliever and another to caffeine.Do you get headaches most days and often in the morning? Do these headaches go away with medicine but return once the medicine wears off? These are common signs of dependence on a pain reliever.Listlessness, nausea, memory or concentration problems, and irritability are also symptoms.\n","Try to wean yourself.\n","Nip your habit in the bud if you notice you are becoming dependent on Excedrin. There are different ways to go about this. You do not have to stop taking the drug entirely, as your body will need to adjust and can slowly wean yourself. There is also the harder cold turkey method.To go cold turkey, just stop taking the drug. Youll be able to kick the habit quickly this way and will see just how much your body craves Excedrin.The cold turkey method is very hard, though. Prepare for severe withdrawal headaches lasting days or even weeks. You may experience a loss of productivity because of them. Many people give up under these circumstances.To wean yourself slowly, reduce the Excedrin dosage you take daily. The idea is to do this gradually so that your body becomes used to less and less until you are no longer taking the medication. While the process will last longer than cold turkey, your withdrawal will not be as bad.Expect your rebound headaches to improve 6 to 12 weeks after youve stopped taking medication entirely.[3]\n","Ask family members for help.\n","Ask family, friends, or your partner for help if you are having trouble reducing your dosage of Excedrin. Their help might be for moral encouragement or more practical, like if you are in withdrawal. They will be more than happy to do so.For example, you might have a family member or friend be your pharmacist. They can hide the pills and only allow you a set amount for that day.Kind words and encouragement from family and loved ones is a great boost. It also helps them know what youre experiencing and why you might be irritable or not your usual self.Loved ones can also help you with the weaning process. You may be in bad shape for a few days with withdrawal. Ask family or friends if they can provide food, for example, or pitch in with your errands.People who take prescription headache medicines like Imitrex often receive just 10 pills for the whole month, so you might consider having a family member \"dispense\" Excedrin to you in this way or limit yourself to 10 per month.\n","Avoid Excedrin in the future.\n","To prevent a relapse, stay away from the drug in the future once youve successfully detoxed and weaned yourself.  There are alternative over-the-counter medications that are less likely to cause addiction, such as Ibuprofen.Talk to your doctor about other possible painkillers if you continue to have headaches or migraines. She should be able to suggest an alternative.Read drug labels in the future to see if they have addictive qualities, as well.\n","Set up an appointment with a doctor.\n","Breaking an addiction is hard. Talk to your doctor about options if you have trouble cutting out Excedrin alone or prefer medical help. She can set up a plan to break your habit and mitigate your symptoms. This is called bridge or transition therapy.[4]Your doctor can prescribe a short-acting and non-habit-forming painkiller, for example. She may also give you meds to alleviate your withdrawal symptoms, like anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids.Your doctor may also put you on a detoxification program.Mostly like you will not need a hospital visit. However, in some cases, you may be admitted for a short stay, particularly if you arent able to stop on your own, are abusing other drugs along with Excedrin, or have limited family support.\n","Begin a detox program if you have other addictions as well.\n","Your doctor may put you in an outpatient treatment plan for addiction if you have other addictions along with your addiction to Excedrin, such as addiction to prescription painkillers or illegal substances. This will involve a detoxification process to remove the drug from your system, helping you to be less dependent on it.Good outpatient centres can cater to specific addictions and tailor your plan. They can also provide resources like counselling and prepare you to cope with any mental obstacles.Take into account the services that each prospective program offers. Also, consider location. Some may want to be close to family and friends. However, people with unhealthy or co-dependent relationships may need to put distance between themselves and loved ones, at least for a time.Your doctor can most likely recommend a drug addiction centre to guide you through the detox process.\n","See a headache specialist or neurologist.\n","If you have been suffering from headaches for a long time and self-medicating with Excedrin, then seeing a specialist may be necessary. A doctor who specializes in headaches or a neurologist can assess your symptoms and run tests to determine if there is an underlying cause. A specialist can also prescribe a treatment plan that will help to prevent you from becoming dependent on Excedrin again.\n","Seek counselling.\n","Some people suffer from both psychological and physical addiction to Excedrin. This means that you become mentally dependent on the drug and, without it, can experience anxiety, a feeling of being unable to cope, a mental obsession with it, mood swings, or insomnia. If you think you are experiencing psychological addiction, set up an appointment with a psychologist who can work with you to kick it.Your therapist will be able to alleviate any concerns that you or your family may have. You can also set up a group family therapy session if needed.To offer you coping strategies, a psychologist may also recommend a course in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. CBT aims to teach you how to identify and stop problematic behaviour.CBT techniques can include discussing the positive and negative effects of your habit, teaching you how to monitor your cravings, and developing ways to deal with cravings and avoid high-risk situations when you might relapse.\n","Consider alternative medicine.\n","Some people find that alternative therapies relieve headaches and can complement other treatments. Since not all of these treatments have proven medical benefits, talk with your doctor before starting one.Acupuncture is one alternative treatment. There is some evidence that this ancient Chinese practice can help to bring headaches under control.[5]Biofeedback is a technique that teaches you better control over your body. You are first hooked to devices that monitor your breathing, heart rate, and other functions and give feedback. The idea is to slowly learn your natural bodily response to pain and how to reduce muscle tension, control your breathing and heart rate, and deal with pain.Some herbs and natural medicines claim to alleviate headaches, like butterbur and feverfew. However, the medical benefits of these herbs are unclear. Talk to a doctor before taking any dietary supplements, especially since they can interact with other drugs you are taking.[6]\n","Cut caffeine out of your diet.\n","Excedrin contains caffeine and can lead to (or worsen) caffeine dependence. Excedrin Migraine, for instance, contains 65 mg of caffeine, or nearly as much as a cup of regular coffee (about 80 mg). Drinking coffee while taking it can also increase your addiction.Reducing your caffeine intake will help to address a possible source of headaches  caffeine withdrawal headaches  that are unrelated to your normal headaches and to rebound headaches.Besides coffee, limit your consumption of other caffeinated substances like colas, black tea, energy drinks, and chocolate.\n","Follow a plan to detox from caffeine.\n","You might find cutting coffee and caffeine out of your life painful. However, you do not have to eliminate them from your life entirely. The aim is only to reduce your intake so you are no longer dependent. People can safely consume coffee two or three times per week without building up a tolerance.As with Excedrin, you can choose to go cold turkey or slowly wean yourself. Cold turkey will be faster but involve worse headaches and poorer concentration.If you decide to go slow, your schedule might look like this. On Day 1, you drink your usual amount. On Days 2-5, make coffee that is half caffeinated and half decaf. On Day 6, blend 25% caffeinated coffee with 75% decaf coffee. At this stage, your body will get used to having less coffee. On Day 7, drink purely decaf coffee.Decaf coffee still has a small amount of the drug, about 2-12 mg.[7] If you want to go fully without caffeine, switch over to a grain or plant alternative like chicory root.Teas are a great, lower-caffeine option. Black and green tea have modest amounts (between 14-70 mg depending on the type and how long you steep it) and will work to cut your withdrawal symptoms. Herbal teas are usually totally caffeine-free.[8]\n","Drink plenty of water.\n","Stay hydrated while you wean yourself off coffee. Some people think the less thirsty you are, the less likely you will be to crave coffee. Gulp an 8 oz. glass of water first thing in the morning and stay well-watered throughout the day.[9]According to the Mayo Clinic, adult men should try to drink at least three liters of water per each day.[10]Women should try to drink about 2.2. litres each day.\n","5 Ways to Accessorize the Little Black Dress - wikiHow\n","Bring your outfit to life with a statement necklace.\n","An eye-catching pendant revitalizes any ensemble.

Keep the wire even while you thread it, so even pieces of wire are going through the pot. Repeat this process with each set of drilled holes along the broken seam.[16]\n","Twist the wires together along the inside of the pot.\n","Grab a pair of pliers and twist the wires together into a coil. Do your best to make this as tight as possible, so the pot stays together.[17]\n","Push the twisted wires against the inner edge of the pot.\n","Press along the coiled wires until theyre snug against the inner wall of your terracotta pot. This way, your pot is much more likely to stay together![18]Once youve twisted and pushed in all your wires, you can use your pot again.\n","How to Freeze Bananas: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Let your bananas ripen before you freeze them.\n","When bananas are ripe, their skins look yellow. Its okay if you let the skins get spotted or brown before you freeze them, but dont freeze the bananas when their skins are still green.[1]\n","Remove the peels from your bananas.\n","Dont leave the peel on your bananas when you freeze them, because it will turn black and slimy in the freezer. Youll be able to get the peel off with a knife, but it will be a lot harder than simply taking the peel of an unfrozen banana.[2]\n","Slice your bananas into rounds about 1 inch (2.5cm) thick.\n","If you slice your bananas thicker, theyll take a little longer to freeze, but it will save you time on the slicing, so its really up to you. You dont have to be very exact with cutting your bananas.[3]\n","Place the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet.\n","Try to have a little space between the pieces so they dont fuse together when they freeze. If youre trying to freeze a bunch of bananas at once, you may need multiple trays.[4]To make it slightly easier to remove the banana slices, you can line the baking sheet with parchment paper, but it will still be pretty easy to get the pieces off without it.[5]The reason we freeze them on a baking sheet first is so they dont fuse together into a solid lump of frozen banana.\n","Freeze the bananas for an hour or until frozen.\n","Place the baking sheets covered in banana pieces into your freezer. You may have to rearrange the items in your freezer slightly to get the trays to fit. Check back on the bananas in about an hour. If they are not frozen solid, check again after another half an hour.[6]You can check if they are done by poking a piece. If its squishy, it needs more time.\n","Move your frozen banana pieces into a bag labeled with the date.\n","Put the coins into a freezer safe plastic bag, remove the air from the bag, and seal it. Label the bag with the date that you froze the bananas, so you dont leave them in your freezer for years by accident.[7]You might want to use a spatula to help you remove the bananas from the baking sheet.\n","Use your frozen bananas in smoothies or milkshakes within 6 months.\n","The next time you are making a beverage in the blender, pull a few pieces of frozen banana from the bag in your freezer. Just stick them in the blender and watch as they turn into a cold, creamy treat.[8]\n","Let your bananas get ripe or overripe.\n","Bananas wont ripen more in the freezer, so dont freeze a green banana. Use a yellow or spotted banana, instead. Over-ripe bananas are great for baking, because they are so sweet, so you can even freeze a banana if the peel is all brown.[9]If your banana is so overripe that its liquid you should just toss it.\n","Peel all of your bananas.\n","Dont freeze a banana with its peel on! The peel will turn black and slimy, which will look gross, and youll have to use a knife to slice it off. Your future self will thank you for putting in a tiny bit of extra work now.[10]Compost your peels if you have compost available.\n","Keep the peeled bananas whole or mash them first.\n","You can leave the bananas whole and easily mash them later after youve defrosted them. However, if you prefer, you can go ahead and mash them now! Put your bananas in a bowl and mash them with a fork until they reach a mushy consistency.[11]Add a few drops of lemon juice to the mashed banana if you care about preserving the color. Since this is for baking though, the color doesnt really matter.If you have a ton of bananas to mash, you may find it easier to mash them in a food processor or blender, but bananas are soft enough to mash by hand.\n","Freeze your bananas in a freezer bag labeled with the date.\n","Scoop the mashed bananas or place the whole bananas into a freezer bag. Make sure that most of the air is out of the bag before you seal it. Write the date on your bag with a permanent marker so that you can figure out how long the bananas have been in your freezer later. Then, just stick the bag in the freezer.[12]\n","Use your bananas in baked goods within 6 months.\n","Take your bananas out of the freezer an hour before you plan to start baking and let them defrost on a plate on the counter. If you still havent used your frozen bananas within 6 months, its time to toss them.[13]Try baking banana bread or banana muffins with your defrosted bananas.If you stored the bananas whole, they should be easy to mash with a fork after they've defrosted.\n","How to Evaluate Speaking Skills (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Define a goal for your assessment or assignment.\n","The goal is what you want your students to achieve through the assessment. Having a goal helps you to decide on criteria and the type of assessment or assessments you want to use.For instance, your goal might be to have students learn how to organize and present information, which would be a good goal for a presentation.Alternatively, maybe your goal is to have students demonstrate knowledge of vocabulary and syntax, in which case a variety of assessments would be appropriate.Other goals might be to establish that students can respond to questions in their second language or to evaluate how well students can think on their feet.\n","Decide on a scale.\n","The scale you use is up to you. If you want a scale that has room for more nuance, try 1-9. If you are trying to keep things simple, try a scale that goes from 1-4 or even a basic scale like excellent, pass, and fail.[1]The detail in your scale depends on what you're using the evaluation for. If you're trying to determine a letter grade, you'll likely need a more detailed scale. If you're just trying to figure out where someone needs improvement, a less detailed scale should be fine.[2]The scale should run from failing on the low end to doing very well on the high end.\n","Make a rubric sheet you can use to grade each student.\n","List the scale along the top of the page by number. Along the side, list each criteria you're evaluating, using a shortened form of the criteria to fit it on the page. Make a copy for each student you plan to evaluate.[3]Have a second page on hand where you list the description for each criteria and each number along the top.\n","Look for how well students use syntax and vocabulary.\n","Syntax is how sentences are structured. Like every other language, English follows rules when it comes to sentence structure, and you can evaluate how well students follow those rules. You can also look at how well students are able to choose the appropriate word, based on both denotation and connotation.[4]Denotation is the strict dictionary definition of the word. Connotation is the social and emotional context behind the word.For instance, \"avoid\" and \"escape\" are considered synonyms, and therefore, have similar denotations. However, they have different connotations, as \"escape\" tends to mean getting out of a bad situation while \"avoid\" can mean not being in the situation in the first place.When establishing your scale for this criteria, you could have things like \"Uses syntax and vocabulary fluently\" on the high end and \"Has trouble forming sentences and choosing words\" on the low end.\n","Check for pronunciation.\n","Pronunciation is another important criteria of spoken language.[5] It refers to how well a person articulates the word and whether they are able to combine words when necessary into contractions.[6]Listen to see how easy you can understand the person. Pay particular attention to words that have difficult spellings, as that makes pronunciation harder.For your scale, you could use \"Pronounces words clearly, uses contractions appropriately\" on the high end and \"Is very difficult to understand, doesn't use contractions\" on the low end. An average student might be \"Pronounces more than half of the words well, uses contractions occasionally.\"\n","Pay attention to coherence and fluency.\n","With this criteria, check how the student is able to string thoughts together. Part of this component is speed, as a more fluent person is able to speak faster. That doesn't mean the student needs to speed through their speech or dialogue. However, it does mean they should be able to connect ideas together in a reasonable time so the listener is able to follow along.[7]Essentially, this criteria is checking to see if the student knows more than just vocabulary. Can they put words together into sentences and sentences together into paragraphs?For this scale, you might use \"Speech flowed together and was easy to understand as a whole\" for the high end, and \"Speech was disconnected, student had trouble piecing thoughts together.\" An average student might be \"Has good grasp of vocabulary; can put sentences together with a little difficulty.\"\n","Watch interactions to assess the ability to think and respond in English.\n","This criteria also tests how well your students listen and comprehend. It requires students to move beyond a prepared speech and actually come up with their own responses.[8]For this scale, you might have \"Able to respond to questions with accuracy\" for the top of the scale and \"Had trouble understanding and replying to questions\" for the bottom. For the middle, you might have \"Could understand what was being asked but could only give rote answers.\"\n","Try a 1-on-1 discussion to evaluate conversational skills.\n","A simple way to evaluate your students is to have them sit down with you for a short discussion. Have a set of prepared questions ahead of time, so that you're asking each student the same questions.[9]The questions can be simple, such as: How are you doing today? What's the weather like outside? or What are your plans for the weekend?The questions could also be themed, such as a weather theme: Is it sunny out? When did it rain last? What was the weather like yesterday? and What's your favorite kind of weather?Try giving your students a selection of topics to prepare for ahead of time, and then choosing 1 or 2 for the exam.\n","Assign students a presentation to assess formal speaking skills.\n","This type of assessment gives students a chance to prepare their speech ahead of time. However, they still must communicate effectively to you and the other students.You can let students choose their topic or assign one to them. The topics can be simple, such as describing how to do something or telling a personal story.\n","Let students prepare a speaking video to evaluate presentation skills.\n","This method is similar to a classroom presentation, but it takes some of the pressure off the student. Try this method to see how a student is progressing throughout a semester, particularly in online classes.[10]Let the student select a topic or assign one. Have a set time limit for the video. Establish the basic points you'd like to see in the video, such as introduction to the topic, a discussion of its relevance, and a conclusion.Be as specific as you can to put students at ease.\n","Ask for a description of an image or images to test a wide range of skills.\n","Present the student with an image or a set of images. Tell the student to describe what's in the image. To increase the difficulty, ask the student to connect a series of images.[11]For instance, you can ask the student to put the images in an order and then explain why they chose that order.You could also ask the student to compare and contrast the pictures.\n","Request that a student put a story in their own words for retention.\n","This method requires that your students be able to retain information, re-organize it, and synthesize it into their own words. It also requires clear pronunciation.[12]For instance, give them a story to read before class. Ask them to retell it to you for the evaluation.Alternatively, give students a text to read for a set period of time in class, then ask each student to come retell it to you privately.\n","Give students text to read aloud to test pronunciation and emphasis.\n","You can ask one student to read a passage, or you can ask several students to read a dialogue. This testing method doesn't require students to come up with their own language, but it does require them to know how to say things and what tone of voice to use.[13]\n","Decide on the time guidelines for each task you want to evaluate.\n","Your students should know ahead of time how much speaking they'll be required to do. Assigning time periods for each task allows them to prepare more thoroughly.For instance, you may want to set a goal of a 5 minute presentation or a 3-4 minute discussion.\n","Provide an example of the task to prepare students.\n","Show students example of what you expect them to do for your class. You can use videos for this purpose. Go through the rubric on each example to show how you'd score each example, explaining as you go along.This shows students exactly what you want and helps put them at ease when it comes time for them to do it. You want students to be as relaxed as possible for the evaluation, so they can do their best.\n","Have students use the rubric for one example.\n","After showing a couple of examples and how you'd grade them, have the students do it. Show them an example, and let each student use your scale to score each criteria. Then, go over the example together.This activity allow students to see exactly what you want, and it can help them improve their own presentation or speaking skills when it comes time to do it themselves.\n","Use the rubric to evaluate each student.\n","As the student performs the requested task, mark a number on the scale for each criteria you've selected. If you've created a detailed rubric, you should be able to do this task mostly objectively.[14]Once you have a number for each criteria, you can take an average of the numbers to assign a grade to the student, if you need to assign a grade.For instance, if you have the numbers 8, 7, 5, 8, and 6 for scores, add them together (34) and divide by how many criteria you have (5) to get 6.8. Use that number to assign a grade.\n","Have students evaluate themselves after they do the assessment.\n","This assessment isn't to punish to student. Rather, it's to get them thinking about their own speaking skills and how they can improve. When they are self-evaluating, they are more likely to show progress.For instance, at the end of a presentation, ask the student to take a few minutes to discuss how they did.\n","3 Ways to Sell Your LEGOs - wikiHow\n","Assess the general condition of your LEGOs.\n","How you list and sell your LEGOs depends on what type of shape they are in. To start the process, determine their general condition. Conditions are typically described as:[1]New (A LEGO set is only considered new if it has never been put together.)Lightly used (Played with but still in near perfect condition)Heavily used (Scratched, lots of wear and tear, and potentially broken pieces)Sealed in BoxSealed in Damaged Box\n","Research your LEGOs to find out what sets you have.\n","LEGOs are typically sold as collections, sets, mini figures, or parts. If you do not have your original packaging or you're unsure which LEGOs you have, inspect your LEGOs for a part number and then look up the numbers online.[2]Once you have the part numbers you can search for them online by entering the number and the word legos.In most cases, the BrickLink catalog website will have your parts listed.The theme or franchise of your LEGO can have a significant impact on value.\n","Inspect your LEGOs for imperfections.\n","Imperfections in your legos can have an impact on their value. Look over each piece and if you see any problems, write down the part and what is wrong with it. This will allow you to give an accurate description of the legos you want to sell. Common imperfections to look for include:[3]Scratches and wearBending stretch marksLoose hingesCracksDeteriorated stickersDiscolorationCleanliness\n","Sort general pieces by color or shape.\n","If you have parts that are not part of a set, make your own groupings to sell together. It's best to either make packs of specific colors or specific shapes. If you have unique pieces, such as jewel rocks, you can list them individually.[4]Your groupings can range from 2 pieces to hundreds of pieces. With specialty pieces, such as antennas, it's best to group just a few together. With general building blocks, you can make groups of hundreds if you have that many.When you make a grouping, write down how many pieces there are and what shape they are in so that you can use this information in your listing.\n","Consult LEGO price guides to determine how much to sell your LEGOs for.\n","There are many LEGO price guides available online. The best resources to find the value of your LEGOs are:[5]BrickLink: The BrickLink price guide displays historical sale prices from the past six months.BrickSet: BrickSet lists Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Prices (MSRP), and also includes information about how rare a given LEGO part or set is, which can have a significant impact on value.eBay Search: Search on eBay for your LEGOs by name or part number. Then filter by completed sales to see what similar LEGOs have recently sold for.\n","Pick a general online selling platform for selling common LEGOs.\n","There are a wide variety of websites that allow you to sell LEGOs. The most popular, and easiest to use, is eBay. eBay is a website where all kinds of items are sold. However, there are also a variety of other sites, including buyback stores.[6]Online buyback stores typically have a form, email address, or phone number to call to start the sales process. They'll ask for a description of your LEGOs, and they might ask for a photo. If they're interested, they'll make you an offer. If you accept, you'll ship your LEGO to them and they'll pay you in cash or store credit. Examples of such stores include The Plastic Brick, Toy Brick Brigade, and Replay Bricks.If you already have an eBay account, it will be easy to sell your LEGOs on that website.\n","Use the website BrickLink to sell specialty and rare LEGOs.\n","BrickLink is a specialty website just for LEGOs. If you have specialty sets or rare pieces, you may have more success selling them on BrickLink, as specialty collectors often use that site.[7]BrickLink functions similarly to eBay and other online selling platforms, expect it's just for selling LEGOs.\n","List everything you know about your LEGOs.\n","You'll need to create a detailed listing, complete with a condition assessment, part numbers, and everything you know about your LEGOs. Include set and mini figure names, collection weights, conditions, status of the packaging (missing, damaged, or new), and anything else you know about your LEGOs.[8]List everything that is included in the sale, as well as any parts that are missing from sets.If you're selling a LEGO collection, you do not need to identify each individual piece, as long as they are all included.If applicable, include your payment and shipping policies. This should include under what conditions you will accept returns. However, on some websites, the shipping costs and policies are set by the company, not you.\n","Include photos in your listing.\n","Take high-quality photos from multiple angles to make it easy to understand what you're selling. Having clear photos of the exact LEGOs you are selling will make your pieces sell much quicker than without them.Show any discoloring, scratches, and cracks in the photos. This will help you avoid disputes and poor ratings because your buyer won't be able to claim that they didn't know what state the LEGOs are in.\n","Ask for a fair price to facilitate quick and hassle-free sales.\n","Set your priorities: do you want a quick and easy sale to cash in fast, or do you have a valuable item that's worth waiting for the right buyer to get the highest price? Make a decision and set a price that you will be happy with, even if it takes awhile to make a sale.[9]Include how much shipping will cost, including whether the buyer will pay it separately or if it is included in the asking price.Collections are typically worth between $5 to $15 per pound, depending on their makeup: mostly bricks, mostly mini figures, a mix of non-LEGO parts (like Hotwheels tires), etc.\n","Ship LEGOs that have sold quickly.\n","Once your items have sold, ship them out as soon as possible. Package the LEGOs well, with a lot of padding to ensure that they don't break in transit.[10]Do not ship LEGOs without payment.Shipping promptly will help you get good reviews, which will help make future listings more attractive to buyers.\n","Sell to brick-and-mortar stores that deal in LEGOs.\n","Toy stores and pawn shops often buy used LEGOs. Take your LEGOs in to the store to see if they're interested in buying. You can find local brick-and-mortar stores with a quick online search.[11]This is a quick way to sell your LEGOs but it won't get you the highest price in most cases.\n","List your LEGOs on local classifieds sites.\n","Websites like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace are great places to sell LEGOs without having to ship them. You will list what you have, just as you would on online selling platforms, but you will need to meet with the person and get payment from them directly.[12]These options are typically unmoderated, so you must be careful to avoid scams, no-shows, and other hassles.\n","Find other LEGO selling opportunities at meetups and in online communities.\n","You can try selling your LEGOs via online LEGO forums and groups. It's also possible to sell LEGOs at local events like flea markets or at a garage sale at your home. Basically, wherever people are selling miscellaneous items, you can try selling your LEGOs there.[13]Online LEGO forums and groups are also great places to trade your LEGOs if your aim is to get a different set or piece without needing to exchange money.\n","Start an online business if you're passionate about selling LEGOs and it's working out for you.\n","Start an online business if you see that your sales are going well. Start researching and buying LEGOs and then resell them on your online store. If you're passionate about LEGOs and you know you have what it takes to recognize a good deal, if you consider yourself an expert in LEGOs, then absolutely open an online store where you can buy and sell LEGOs. Issue a press release on relevant news sites about your business so you can reach millions of readers.\n","How to Adjust a Front Bicycle Derailleur: 15 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Know what a properly adjusted front derailleur looks like.\n","Your goal is for the front derailleur to sit comfortably above the chains, with the outside plate 2-3 millimeters above the largest chain ring. It will be aligned so that it curves parallel to the chain rings. It should sit parallel with the chain.[1]If the derailleur is rubbing up against a ring or is caught on something, do not ride the bike. Instead, reset your front derailleur.\n","Diagnose your problem.\n","Place the bike on a repair stand or flip it over so it rests on the seat and handlebars. Shift the front derailleur up and down while pedaling with your hand. Can it get to all 2-3 gears? Is there clicking, rubbing, or grinding? Make a note of any problem areas and remember them as you move through your adjustments. Be sure to inspect the cables and housing as well.If the front derailleur doesn't move when you actuate the shifter, the cable could be corroded.  If this is the case or if you notice cracks, splinters, or fraying, replace both the cable and the housing.Place the chain on the smallest gear in the front and release all tension from the shifter. Feel the cable and adjust the tension until it is barely taut.Reposition the derailleur if it appears to be crooked. Replace the derailleur or shifter if they are broken.Also, the rear derailleur needs to be correctly adjusted before continuing, so check it if it is shifting correctly.\n","Shift your bike into a low gear.\n","Make sure the chain is on the middle cog at the back and the smallest chainring in front. This ensures that the chain isn't stretched diagonally and loosens the derailleur cable so that it is easier to manage.\n","Loosen the cable bolt and tighten the derailleur cable.\n","Right above the derailleur is a thin cable, clamped in place by a bolt or screw. The derailleur is usually attached to the bike frame (the metal skeleton of the bike). Grip the top of the cable and pull up on it, then loosen the bolt. Pull the cable up so that it is tight, then re-tighten the bolt again. This will clamp the bolt down on the cable so it can't move.This may move the derailleur slightly, but you'll be adjusting it again in a minute. Right now you want to make sure that your derailleur cable is tight and has no slack so that the whole thing functions smoothly.\n","Locate your limit screws.\n","There are two small screws on the top or sides of your derailleur, one labeled \"L\" and the other \"H.\" They are likely not entirely screwed in, and poke slightly up and out of the derailleur. These are your Low and High limit screws, and they control how far to the left or right your derailleur can move. They are adjusted with a normal Phillips (\"star\" or  \"+\") screwdriver.[2]The L controls how far towards your bike the derailleur can go. The H controls how far out and away from your bike it can go.If your screws aren't labeled, you can easily test them out. Shift into your smallest ring up front. Turn one screw a full turn in each direction, watching the derailleur. If it moves, this is the Lower (L) limit, if it does not, try the other one. When this one moves, mark it with an L for future reference.[3]\n","Align the low end of your derailleur.\n","Shift into the smallest chainring in the front and the largest in the back so that the chain is completely to the left and closest to the bike frame. Turn the L screw so that the derailleur has 2-3 mm of space on either side of the chain.You should see the derailleur move as you turn the screw.\n","Align the high end of your derailleur.\n","Pedal the bike and shift the front to the biggest cog and the back to the smallest gear. The chain should be complete to the right on the bike and farthest from the bike frame. Turn the H limit screw until the derailleur is 2-3 mm on either side of the chain so that it has plenty of space to move.[4]\n","Adjust the back derailleur into the middle cog, then test your shifting in the front.\n","Shift the back gears to something in the middle so that it doesn't pull your chain either way as you shift. Then, pedal the bike and shift up and down through the front derailleur, making sure that you don't have any issues. Adjust the limit screws as necessary, and have fun riding.Setting your limits too far to either side can cause the chain to slip off, but you should be able to see if it is this far before you start testing.\n","Reset your derailleur if it is hitting the chain rings, bent, or angled awkwardly.\n","The limit screws are only going to fix so much if the derailleur is in need of serious adjustments. If you feel the derailleur hitting chain rings, notice that it is angled, or see that it is too high, you'll have to reset the derailleur and start again.\n","Shift to your leftmost rings.\n","Shift to the smallest ring in the front and the largest in the back. You may need to put the bike on a stand or turn it upside down to easily pedal and shift at once.\n","Loosen the barrel adjusters to relieve cable tension.\n","Barrel adjusters are usually located at the end of your derailleur cable, near the handle bars. To find them, follow the front derailleur cable as far as it goes until you get to a small, spinnable cylinder. Turn this clockwise as far as it goes.Count the number of rotations you make on the barrel. You'll want to return it back into approximately the same position when you're done.\n","Unclamp the bolt holding the derailleur cable in place.\n","Above the derailleur is a cable that runs all the way to your shifter. It is held in place by a small bolt that prevents it from moving or sliding. Undo this bolt enough that the cable can move freely if pulled but doesn't just slide out on its own.[5]\n","Undo the bolts clamping the derailleur to the bike frame carefully.\n","You do not want this to move seriously, as any major movements will change your entire alignment. Undo the bolts just enough so that you can wiggle and shift the derailleur's position.\n","Move the derailleur gently into the correct place.\n","If the derailleur is angled, twist it so that it is parallel to the chain, being careful not to change the height. If it is touching the top of the chain ring, move it up a few millimeters so that it sits above the biggest cog. Your goals are:1-3 mm above the largest chainring. You should be able to snugly fit a penny between the outer plate of the derailleur and the teeth of the ring.Both plates parallel to the chain.Curve of derailleur matches the curve of the cogs.[6]\n","Readjust your cable and limit screws.\n","Once you've made your changes, you'll need to readjust the derailleur so that it runs smoothly. To do so, pull the cable taut and then reclamp it underneath the bolt. Then adjust your limit screws.Be sure to lube your chain and keep it clean for the best shifting. Retighten your barrel adjusters too.\n","3 Ways to Stop Bleeding Hemorrhoids - wikiHow\n","Soak in warm water or a sitz bath.\n","To reduce irritation, ease pain, and help shrink the veins, soak the hemorrhoids for 15 to 20 minutes three times a day in warm, not hot, water.[1] If you don't want to run a bath, try a sitz bath, which is a plastic tub that goes over your toilet seat. This lets you soak your buttocks and hips while in a seated position. It can reduce irritation, spasms of the rectal muscle, and itching.[2]You can also place  cup of sea salt in the sitz bath and sit 30 minutes at a time. Salt is an excellent antibacterial and is used to help with wound healing and drawing out infection.[3]You may also add witch hazel, known for being a soothing and cooling remedy for hemorrhoids. This should be done a minimum of once a day and the Sitz bath should last for anywhere between 15 and 20 minutes.[4]\n","Apply an ice pack to the hemorrhoids.\n","Place the ice pack in freezer until it's completely frozen. Take care not to apply the ice directly to the hemorrhoids. Instead, wrap the compress in a clean towel or cloth before pressing it gently on the hemorrhoids. Do not leave the pack on for long periods of time or it may damage the surrounding skin. It is best to apply for few minutes, remove it until your skin is back to room temperature and then apply it again.This will help reduce the pain and swelling by reducing inflammation.[5] It will also constrict the vessels which will stop the bleeding.\n","Apply a topical cream.\n","[6] Try a topical cream with phenylephrine to constrict the vessels, which may reduce bleeding. You can also apply a cream to sooth the pain, irritation, and itching (which may cause bleeding). However, these will not stop the bleeding. Soothing creams can include hydrocortisone, aloe, witch hazel (herbal plant extract), and vitamin E.If you use hydrocortisone, apply it morning and night, but don't use it for more than one week.[7] Too much absorption may lead to an imbalance in your hypothalamus and pituitary hormones or cause the skin in the area to become thin.\n","Use soft toilet paper and resist the urge to scratch.\n","Rough toilet paper can scratch and/or irritate the skin even more. To soothe the pain and reduce irritation, use moist or medicated towelettes. You can also use witch hazel, hydrocortisone, aloe, or vitamin E medicated pads. Do not wipe aggressively, which can irritate or cause further bleeding. Pat or blot the area instead.Scratching will only increase the bleeding and irritation, causing extra stress on your already tender hemorrhoids. This could lead to further infection.\n","Take supplements to reduce bleeding.\n","Many of these supplements may be hard to find in drug stores, so check for them online and in herbal stores. Always talk with your doctor before taking supplements, especially if you're taking other medications. If you're pregnant or nursing, talk with your doctor before supplementing, since most of these have not been tested for use by pregnant or nursing women. These supplements or traditional medicines include:Fargelin extra: Take these traditional Chinese medicine tablets three or four times a day to strengthen veins which can reduce bleeding.[8]Oral Flavonoids: These have been shown to reduce bleeding, pain, itching, and recurrence. They increase vascular tone which reduces the leaking of tiny blood vessels (capillaries).[9]Calcium dobesilate or doxium tablets: Take these for two weeks and follow the packaged instructions. These drugs have been shown to decrease leaking of tiny blood vessels (capillaries), prevent clots, and improve blood viscosity. All of these things can reduce the swelling of tissues that cause hemorrhoids.[10]\n","Reduce pressure on the hemorrhoids.\n","This can help prevent or put less strain on the hemorrhoids. Eat a high-fiber diet to soften your stools and reduce constipation. Try to eat fruits, vegetables, and whole grains or take supplements (aim for 25 grams a day for women or 38 grams for men of total fiber). Drink plenty of fluids and establish regular bowel habits and especially avoid straining when having a bowel movement You should also avoid sitting for long periods of time which can increase pressure on your hemorrhoid veins, causing them to bleed. Exercise and walk to reduce the pressure.[11]Use a donut cushion to help ease your body weight off the affected area. To use it, sit on the center of the cushion with your anal area right over the gap. It may actually put more pressure on the anal area, so stop using it if your symptoms get worse or bleeding continues or starts again.\n","Get a hemorrhoidectomy for external or internal hemorrhoids.\n","This is the usual method for treating external hemorrhoids, especially if they are large or haven't responded to less invasive procedures. Your surgeon removes hemorrhoids with various tools such as scissors, scalpels, or a ligasure (device that delivers electrical current to seal bleeding hemorrhoids). You'll be sedated using a local anesthetic combined with sedation, a spinal anesthetic or a general anesthetic.[12][13]Hemorrhoidectomy is the most effective and complete way to treat severe or recurring hemorrhoids. It can be painful, but medications, sitz bath, and/or ointments can be prescribed or used after the procedure for comfort.Compared with hemorrhoidectomy, stapling has been associated with a greater risk of recurrence and rectal prolapse, where part of the rectum protrudes from the anus.[14]\n","Have a rubber band ligation for internal hemorrhoids.\n","Your doctor will insert a probe through an anoscope (plastic device inserted in anus to view rectum). He will then attach a rubber band-like device at the base of the hemorrhoid. The device will cut off blood circulation and lead to the hemorrhoid scarring, which shrinks and eliminates the hemorrhoid after a time.[15]You may feel uncomfortable after the procedure. Get some relief by using a sitz bath, warm water soaks, and/or topical ointment.\n","Get injection (sclerotherapy) for internal hemorrhoids.\n","Your doctor will use a plastic device inserted into the anus to view the rectum (anoscope). The doctor will use it to inject a needle with chemical solutions such as 5% phenol in oil, vegetable oil, quinine, and urea hydrochloride or hypertonic salt solution at the base of the hemorrhoids. These chemical solutions will cause the veins to shrink.Sclerotherapy is considered less effective than rubber band litigation.[16]\n","Have laser or radio treatment (infrared coagulation) for internal hemorrhoids.\n","Your doctor may use infrared lasers or radio frequencies to coagulate the veins near the hemorrhoids. If the infrared method is used, a probe is applied to the base of the hemorrhoid. If a radio frequency is used, a ball electrode is connected to a radio-frequency generator. This is placed on the hemorrhoidal tissue, which causes it to coagulate and evaporate.Infrared treatments are more likely to result in recurring hemorrhoids, compared to rubber band litigation.[17]\n","Get cryotherapy for internal hemorrhoids.\n","Your doctor will use a probe capable of applying cold temperatures to the base of the hemorrhoid. This should cause destruction of the tissue. But, this method isn't used very often, since the hemorrhoids usually return.\n","Staple the internal hemorrhoids.\n","Your surgeon will use a device to staple slipped or prolapsed internal hemorrhoids back within the anal canal. This will cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoids so the tissue eventually dies and stops bleeding.[18]The recovery time is usually faster and involves less pain than a hemorrhoidectomy.[19]\n","Learn the causes of hemorrhoids.\n","Chronic constipation, straining, and long periods of sitting on the toilet are causes associated with hemorrhoids. These can all put more pressure on and block your veins, impairing circulation. Pregnancy is another condition that puts a lot of pressure on these veins, especially during delivery when straining happens and can lead to hemorrhoids.Hemorrhoids are more common as you get older and in people who are overweight.Hemorrhoids can either be internal (inside the rectum) or external (around the outside of the anus). Internal hemorrhoids are painless while external ones are painful. But, both types can lead to bleeding if they rupture.[20]\n","Recognize the symptoms of hemorrhoids.\n","If you have internal hemorrhoids, it may be hard to see symptoms until they are bleeding and they'll probably be painless. But, if you have external hemorrhoids, several symptoms will appear including:[21]Painless bleeding during bowel movements. There won't be very much blood and it will be bright red.Itching or irritation in your anal region.Pain or discomfort.Swelling around your anus.A sensitive or painful lump of tissue near your anus.Leaking feces.\n","Check to see if you have hemorrhoids.\n","Look in the mirror with your back turned to it and note any lumps or mass-like protrusions around your anus. The color may vary from your normal skin tone to darker red. It may be painful if you press on the lumps. If so, you probably have external hemorrhoids. Pay attention to any blood on the toilet paper after you use the bathroom and wipe. Hemorrhoid blood is usually bright red, rather than dark (which could indicate bleeding from somewhere deeper in your digestive system).It can be hard to see internal hemorrhoids at home without the right tools.  Make an appointment with your doctor. You'll be asked to give a detailed medical history to catch any other possible reasons for bleeding such as colon cancer and polyps, since both of these masses can bleed.\n","Know when to see a doctor.\n","If you still have symptoms or pain after a week of home remedies, you should see your doctor for an exam. Bleeding can be a cause for concern, especially if you're at risk for or have another condition, like inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. You should also get medical attention if the blood is dark red or your stools are dark/tarry in color. These can mean there's bleeding higher up in your intestines or from a bleeding mass.[22]Try to estimate how much blood you've lost. If you start to feel fatigue/anxiety, look pale pale, have cold hands or feet, a high heart rate, or confusion accompanied by blood loss, you should see your doctor immediately. You should also be examined if the amount of blood has increased.[23]\n","Know what to expect from a medical examination.\n","Your doctor will determine if you have hemorrhoids by looking at the outside of your anus and performing a digital rectal exam. Your doctor will insert a lubricated index finger to feel the walls of your rectum for lumps, masses, and look for any blood. If it's suspected that you have internal hemorrhoids, the doctor may insert an anoscope (a plastic tube) through your anus into the rectum. This lets the doctor shine a light and look for swollen, distended, or bleeding veins.Your doctor may do a guaiac test, which involves a smear of fecal matter on a strip of paper. This can detect microscopic blood cells within the feces, which can indicate several conditions including hemorrhoids, colon cancer, and polyps.If you do have a guaiac test, it is important not to eat red meat, turnips, radish, horseradish, cantaloupe or uncooked broccoli three days before, since they can cause false positive results.[24]\n","How to Do Toe Raises: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Start with seated toe raises.\n","Sit on the edge of a sturdy chair with your knees at right angles and your feet flat on the floor. Sit up straight with your shoulders back. You can hold the side of the chair or rest your hands flat on your thighs. Then, raise your toes up off the ground as far as you can. Hold the position for 10 seconds, breathing deeply, then release. Repeat 20 to 30 times.[2]Seated toe raises are easier to start with because your feet are not supporting your body weight. Later, when your feet are stronger, you can move on to standing toe raises.This exercise is safe to do every day, or as needed if your feet are feeling stiff or sore. However, you shouldn't continue this exercise if it causes pain.\n","Progress to standing toe raises with support.\n","Use a sturdy table or the back of a sturdy chair to balance. Stand with your feet about hip-width apart and your back straight. Just as with seated toe raises, raise your toes off the ground, dropping your weight back to your heels. Hold for 10 seconds then release. Repeat 20 to 30 times.[3]Use the chair or table for balance, but be careful not to collapse into it or lean on it. Start by using 2 hands to maintain balance. With time, you can move on to just using one hand, then finally no hands.This exercise is generally safe to do every day, as long as you don't feel any pain while doing it. Once you progress to doing toe raises without support, you can even do mini-sets throughout the day, such as when you're cooking or brushing your teeth.\n","Counter standing toe raises with heel raises.\n","Standing tall, start by raising your toes and rolling your weight back on your heels. Hold that position for a full breath cycle, then slowly roll forward onto your toes. Return to a neutral, flat-footed position. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions of this exercise. Focus on maintaining a smooth, controlled movement.[4]Combining these movements stretches and strengthens your entire foot by taking it through its full range of motion. You'll also strengthen your shins.This exercise is safe to do every day. However, you should stop if you feel any pain in your feet or shins.\n","Try toe raises on one foot at a time.\n","Doing basic toe raises on one leg at a time allows you to isolate and train each foot separately. This is helpful if one leg is stronger than the other, or if you've previously injured one leg, because it enables you to feel the difference between the two sides.If one side is noticeably weaker than the other, you might want to add more repetitions with that side to bring it up to the same level as the stronger side.You can generally do this exercise every day. Use a wall to help maintain your balance and posture on one leg.\n","Add a resistance band to strengthen your feet and lower legs.\n","Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you and loop a resistance band around the balls of your feet. Pull the resistance band taut, then try to flex your foot forward as far as it will go. Hold the flex for a breath cycle, then bring it back towards your body using a slow, controlled movement. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions of this exercise.[5]If you don't have resistance bands, you can also work with a rolled-up towel or T-shirt looped around your feet.You can do this exercise with both feet at the same time or alternating feet. If you only do one foot at a time, bend the knee of the other leg so the foot is resting flat on the ground.Do resistance exercises 2 to 3 times a week.\n","Raise up onto the balls of your feet to do a basic calf raise.\n","Start in a standing position with your feet about hip-width apart and your back straight. Raise up onto the balls of your feet, or even your toes, keeping your back straight. Then slowly lower back down. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions of this exercise.[6]When you first start out, you might want to use a table, counter, or sturdy chair to support your balance  especially if you're not accustomed to standing on your toes.It's easy to start pitching forward while you're doing this exercise. Make sure you're standing tall and your head is moving upward, not forward.This exercise is safe to do every day. You might also incorporate it as a warm-up or cool-down for your lower legs, either before or after aerobic exercise, such as running or biking.You can find calf raise machines in most gyms.[7]\n","Alternate between your feet rather than doing both at the same time.\n","Stand in front of a wall, about arm's length away. Press your palms against the wall for balance. Bend one knee to lift your foot off the ground, then roll up to the ball of your other foot. Lower and repeat. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions of this exercise on each leg.[8]With this exercise, you have the option of alternating feet with each calf raise or doing all the repetitions with one foot and then switching to the other. Do it whichever way is easiest for you to keep up with.See if you can squeeze the quad and lock out the knee as you come up onto the ball of your foot.[9]Single-leg exercises can help you pinpoint any muscle imbalances in your legs.[10]\n","Stand on a step to drop your heels below your toes.\n","When doing a calf raise, you can increase resistance without any equipment by simply standing on the edge of a stair or any stable raised surface. Keep your toes and the balls of your feet on the stair and allow the back half of your foot and your heels to hang off the edge.[11]Raise up on the balls of your feet the same way you did with a basic calf raise. You'll feel the burn in your calves because your heels are traveling a longer distance and gravity provides a little more resistance. Start with 2 sets of 5 repetitions and work your way up to 3 sets of 10 repetitions.Use this exercise as a progression of regular calf raises after they stop being challenging or providing the stretch you need.\n","Hold a dumbbell in each hand while doing a basic calf raise.\n","If a basic calf raise isn't providing much of a challenge, adding weight can make it more of a workout. Hold the same amount of weight on each side, even if you're only doing calf raises on one leg at a time.[12]You can add weight to any of the calf-raise variations as well  just make sure you can maintain balance while completing the exercise with correct form.If you need to use a wall or other structure to maintain your balance, you can use ankle weights to add resistance.Do resistance exercises 2 to 3 times a week. If you already have a strength-building resistance routine built into your exercise regimen, simply add this exercise to your existing routine.\n","How to Start a Blog For Free (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Visit free blogging sites to see examples of blogging templates and features.\n","The following are the most popular sites for free blogging:WordPress.

Similarly, if you have a lot of rolling luggage or have a wheeled stroller, dont use an escalator. If your luggage or stroller overbalances, they will fall over and roll. This could injure any children in the stroller and injure the passengers behind you.[1]\n","Prepare yourself to enter the escalator.\n","Stand in front of the escalator with your bags and packages grasped firmly in one hand. If there are any children with you, hold them with one hand. Its important to have a hand free to hold the handrail when you enter the escalator.Make sure youre entering the correct escalator  the stairs should be moving in the direction of your path, not towards you.\n","Step carefully onto the escalator.\n","Stand near the center of the steps and extend a foot forward. Aim for the middle of the step.[2] Extend your free hand and grab the handrail as you move. Once you step onto the escalator, quickly step up with your other foot as well. Keep a firm grip on the handrail.Be especially cautious when wearing Crocs. Soft shoes such as Crocs can be dangerous when riding escalators as they can get easily stuck in moving parts. If you wear soft shoes onto the escalator, it is especially important to stand on the center of the step to avoid injury.[3]\n","Plan your practice time.\n","If youre nervous about using an escalator and need some time to gather your courage, consider practicing early in the morning or late at night. Hopefully there will be fewer people during these hours, allowing you to take all the time you need without inconveniencing anyone. Similarly, have a friend stand behind you and usher others away to give you more time to ready yourself.\n","Stand properly on the escalator.\n","Always face the direction of movement. If you face the wrong way on an escalator, you risk falling and injuring yourself. Remember, stand at the center of the step with your feet away from the sides, especially if youre wearing sandals or Crocs. Similarly, keep an eye on loose clothing and make sure it doesnt get stuck.[4]Never sit on the escalator step, even if youre tired. Its dangerous for you as well as for other passengers.Stand to the right on the steps so that people can walk past you if they're in a hurry. This is considered escalator etiquette. However, remember walking on the escalator is not considered safe behavior.\n","Keep a steady grip on the handrail.\n","Hold the handrail firmly with your back straight and arm relaxed. Dont lean on the handrail or bend over the sides. Using the handrail properly will help improve your balance while you ride and help you catch yourself if you accidentally fall.\n","Be careful with your bags.\n","Dont rest bags or other items on the handrail as the handrail is only for hands. Keep all bags and packages firmly held in your free hand. Dont rest them on the steps either as they can get caught in the moving parts. If you have too many bags to hold with one hand, it may be better to take the elevator.\n","Step off promptly.\n","When nearing the top of the escalator, step off promptly and confidently. If you hesitate, you will end up falling onto the floor and potentially injuring yourself. To step off, simply lift your foot and place it on the stationary metal plate at the top of the escalator.[5] Release the handrail and continue walking forward.\n","Keep loose clothing clear of the top step.\n","Its easy for small, light objects such as the hems of clothing to get pinched here. Make sure your loose clothing is either gathered in your hand or high enough from the escalator that it wont get caught. Some people believe that an escalator can reach out and grab you as you ride. This is a common myth. As long as you keep your shoes and loose clothing away from moving parts, you will be fine.If your clothing gets caught, try to press the emergency stop button at the top or bottom of the escalator. If this doesnt work, try to get out of the clothing. Its better to be embarrassed and naked than injured!\n","Move away from the exit area quickly.\n","If you dawdle at the exit you could cause an accident. After all, the people moving towards you on the escalator cant control their speed. If you block the exit, they will simply run into you. Instead, walk quickly away from the exit area before setting down your bag or stopping.\n","How to Get Daedric Armor and Weapons Without Smithing in Skyrim\n","Loot high-level boss chests at the end of dungeons.\n","The easiest way to randomly find Daedric equipment is to reach a high enough level and start clearing out as many dungeons as you can. This involves making your way through the dungeon, fighting monsters, bypassing traps and then defeating the boss monsters at the end of the dungeon. You will eventually reach the end of the dungeon where you will find a large, prominent chest containing valuable loot - the boss chest of the dungeon. Daedric weapons and armor start appearing in the boss chests you find at the end of each dungeon; typically before you find a shortcut leading out of the dungeon you just cleared. All you need to do is roam Skyrim, find random dungeons to explore and clear them out.Unenchanted Daedric weapons start appearing at level 46, enchanted Daedric weapons start appearing at level 47, unenchanted Daedric armor starts appearing at level 48 and enchanted Daedric armor starts appearing at level 49.[1]\n","Buy from the Dremora Merchant at higher levels.\n","If you have the Dragonborn expansion installed, you will come across Black Books that grant you a variety of powers for you to use as you need them. The Black Book: Untold Legends can be found in Benkongerike in Solstheim, and choosing the Black Market power will give you the ability to summon a Dremora Merchant for 15 seconds that you can buy from and sell to. Once you reach level 47, the Black Merchant will begin selling enchanted and unenchanted Daedric equipment.The Dremora Merchant is the only merchant not affiliated to the Thieves Guild that will sell Daedric armor and weapons to you.\n","Buy from two of the Thieves Guild fences.\n","Becoming a member of the Thieves Guild and progressing through the Guilds questline will open up fences that you can sell stolen goods to while offering a variety of equipment, consumables and crafting components. Two of these fences, Tonilia and Niranye, will occasionally stock Daedric weapons that you can buy once you hit level 47.[2]Tonilia can be found in the Ragged Flagon, and you can begin trading with her once you complete the quest Taking Care of Business.[3] She will stock up all sorts of Daedric weaponry at random.Niranye can be found in the market district of Windhelm, and she becomes available to trade with after finishing the quest Summerset Shadows.[4] She will usually stock Daedric bows, so archers will have a much easier time finding their weapons of choice with Niranye.\n","Slay Revered or Legendary Dragons.\n","If you have the Dawnguard expansion installed, you can begin encountering Revered Dragons at level 59 and Legendary Dragons at level 78. They will be really, really hard to kill if you are not properly equipped and prepared to deal with them. This means preparing potions to restore health, restore magicka, restore stamina, resist fire, resist frost and resist magic. Wearing enchanted equipment that boosts resistances against fire, frost and magic will also help you better survive their hard-hitting blows. Also, shouts like Dragonrend and Become Ethereal are particularly useful against these types of dragons as theyll help you better survive their nasty breath attacks and Drain Vitality shouts. The fact that you can loot Daedric equipment from their bodies, however, makes killing them a particularly nice reward for the effort required.[5][6]If you have trouble slaying Revered and Legendary dragons, you may find this WikiHow article on killing dragons in Skyrim very useful.\n","Craft your own Daedric Equipment.\n","If you are a mage that has the sigil stone from the quest Conjuration Ritual Spell, then you can craft Daedric weapons and armor using the Atronach Forge in the Midden. [7] You will need to undertake specific steps to use the Forge to create Daedric equipment as well as obtain the necessary equipment for the process. This makes the whole process a lot complicated than simply increasing your Smithing capabilities, but its nonetheless a viable option for creating Daedric equipment without spending a single point on Smithing.\n","Obtain a sigil stone.\n","Raise your Conjuration to 90, join the College of Winterhold and speak with Phinis Gestor. He will give you the Conjuration Ritual Spell; telling you that he needs a sigil stone. He will teach you how to summon an unbound dremora, which you will use to summon the said dremora. Summon and kill the dremora twice, and it will yield to you. Summon the dremora once more, and it will return with a sigil stone. Give the stone to Phinis Gestor, and he will use it give you a spell tome that will allow you to cast Flame Thrall before giving the stone back to you.[8]\n","Place the sigil stone in the Atronach Forge.\n","Once you have the Sigil Stone, enter the Midden in the College of Winterhold and make your way to the Atronach Forge. Place the sigil stone in a pedestal on the Forge, and you will open up a new line of items to craft  including Daedric equipment.\n","Craft unenchanted Daedric Equipment.\n","You will need a Black Soul Gem (filled or unfilled), a Centurion Dynamo Core, a Daedra Heart and the Ebony equivalent of the weapon or armor you want to craft. If you want to craft, say, a Daedric Sword, you will need an Ebony Sword to complete the recipe.[9]Do note that crafting Daedric Boots using the Atronach forge is bugged, as it will give you a pair of inferior Dremora boots instead. This is fixed in the Unofficial Skyrim Patch version 1.2 or higher, which can be installed on PC versions of Skyrim.\n","Craft a random enchanted Daedric equipment.\n","Prepare a filled Greater Soul Gem or better (Grand and Black gems count), an ebony ingot and void salts for armor or a silver sword/greatsword for weapons. This is the most efficient way to craft Daedric equipment with the Forge once you consider the commonness of the required components, although you wont be able to control what enchantments will pop up as a result of the crafting process. These enchantments will thus cover all possible enchantments, ranging from dealing bonus fire/frost/lightning damage and banishing summoned Daedra for the weapons to fortifying your skills and increasing the damage you do with certain weapons for the armor.Crafting random enchanted Daedric weapons is bugged, as this will only produce warhammers and war axes.

I love you so much, and I just wanted to wish you a great day at work today. Call or text me if you need anything.\n","Include more physical intimacy in your day-to-day life.\n","Create a romantic ritual with your wife by finding ways to insert kisses and declarations of love into your daily life. Center your hugs, kisses, and sweet nothings around ordinary events, instead of waiting for anniversaries and other special occasions.[14]For instance, consider kissing your wife every time she gets home from work.\n","Give her a back massage if shes had a tough day.\n","Pay attention to your wifes mood at the end of the day. If she had a rough day at work or seems to be in a bad mood, ask her if shed like a back rub. Even if youre not a professional masseuse, this simple gesture can go a long way with your wife.[15]Foot and neck massages are also a great option!\n","Get in the habit of expressing your feelings of love.\n","Dont be shy when it comes to letting your wife know how you feel. Instead, try to let her know at random times, or in casual conversation.[16] While youre not reinventing the romantic wheel with this gesture, you can add a timeless sense of romance to your marriage by telling your wife that you love her.[17]\n","How to Make an Indicator for Acids and Bases Using Hibiscus Petals\n","Youll need around 2 to 3 grams of dried hibiscus petals.\n","Place your petals in a 150 mL beaker along with 50 to 60 mL of water to start. The water wont change colors just yet, so hang tight![1]If you gathered your own hibiscus flowers, gently pluck off the petals and spread them out on a paper towel. Leave the petals in the sun for 2 to 3 days until the leaves look crispy and slightly brown.\n","You can use a Bunsen burner or a hot plate.\n","Place your beaker onto the burner, then turn it up high. Get the water boiling for about 5 minutes until it starts to turn dark red.[2]No need to stir your mixturejust sit back and relax.\n","Turn off the burner and let the mixture sit.\n","This will allow all the sediment to settle at the bottom of the pot. You can use this time to ready the rest of your equipment, like a clean beaker and a few test tubes.[3]If you pour the liquid too early, you might end up with a chunky, lumpy indicator.\n","Try not to disturb the petals at the bottom of the liquid.\n","Gently pour the liquid into a clean 100 mL beaker, separating it from the petals. If youre having trouble, set a strainer on top of your beaker and strain the liquid instead.[4]The liquid will be a deep red color, but you should still be able to see light shining through it.\n","Pick out the substance youd like to test with your hibiscus solution.\n","Add around 1 tsp (5.6 g) of it to the bottom of a test tube, then add 4 to 5 mL of water to the tube with a dropper. Cap the test tube with your finger and shake it up to dissolve the substrate in the water.[5]The substance you choose is up to you, but people often use salt, window cleaner, orange juice, apple juice, or toilet bowl cleaner.\n","Put your indicator to the test!\n","Use a dropper to add 4 or 5 drops of hibiscus water to the test tube. Youll notice a color change right away as the hibiscus petals interact with the chemical.[6]Hibiscus flowers contain the colour pigment anthocyanin, which is a natural chemical indicator.\n","The color change will tell you if its acidic or basic.\n","The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of less than 7 indicates acidity, while a pH of more than 7 indicates a base. Anywhere from dark pink to pale pink usually indicates an acid, while dark gray to green colors usually indicate a base. The rest of the colors indicate:[7]Dark pink: pH 2Pink: pH 3 to pH 4Pale pink: pH 5Lavender: pH 6Gray: pH 7 or pH 8Dark gray: pH 9Brown: pH 10 or pH 11Green: pH 12\n","Easy Ways to Add Salt to a Pool: 11 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Read your chlorine generator's instructions to find its target salt level.\n","Different systems require different amounts of salt in order to function properly. To find out exactly how much salt you need to add, consult the literature that came with your salt chlorine generator. This information is critical, so it should be one of the first items you come across.[1]With some systems, important information like salt concentration and frequency of applications might be displayed directly on the generator itself for ease of reference.\n","Purchase a few bags of salt intended for use in swimming pools.\n","You can buy swimming pool salt from your local pool and spa specialty retailer. Any type of food-quality, non-iodized salt will do. Ideally, however, you should shop around for a product with 99% purity or higher.[2]Swimming pool salt is typically sold in 4080lb (1836kg) bags. You'll most likely need at least 2-3 bags for a single treatment. However, it's a good idea to go ahead and stock up, as you'll be treating your pool periodically.High-purity salts dissolve faster and are easier for salt chlorine generators to process than lower-purity ones.\n","Test the salinity of your pool\n","using a salt test strip. Fill the small vial included with the test kit with water from your pool, then insert the test strip and let it sit for the length of time specified by the instructions. When the strip changes color, remove it from the water sample and compare it with the color chart displayed on the test kit's packaging to determine the salinity. The depth of the color will tell you approximately how much salt is currently in your pool.Like your salt chlorine generator, the concentrations indicated by salt test strips are given in parts per million.Get in the habit of checking the salinity in your pool at least 2-3 times a week to make sure your generator is operating at its targeted salt level.[3]\n","Look up a salt table to find out exactly how much salt to add.\n","Your salt chlorine generator or packaged salt product may include some general guidelines for treatment. If not, you can pull up a useful reference chart online by running a quick search for pool salt table. One of these tables will tell you how much salt to use for a pool of a given size, shape, and volume.[4]Most salt tables provide measurements in both pounds and PPM, which can make it easier for you to pour in just the right amount.For a 12ft (3.7m) circular pool that holds 3,000 gallons (11,000l) of water, you'd need to add 87 pounds (39kg) of salt, or about 2 whole bags, in order to bring it up to the recommended concentration.Never add salt to your swimming pool indiscriminately. Doing so could lead to deterioration of the walls, floor, and other surfaces over time.\n","Turn off your pool's salt chlorine generator before adding the salt.\n","Head down to your pool's control unit, locate the switch that corresponds to the generator, and flip it to the Off position. Adding the salt while the generator is operational can place excess strain on it, potentially resulting in damage and costly repairs.[5]Some salt chlorine generators may need to continue running during treatment to process the salt. Refer to the literature included with your generator to find out whether to turn it off or leave it on.\n","Walk around the pool pouring in the salt a little at a time.\n","Snip the corner off of a bag of salt and begin shaking it in while you slowly circle the pool. This will help distribute it more evenly throughout the water. Try to sprinkle the salt 12 feet (0.300.61m) away from the edge of the pool to keep it from piling up around the walls or simply drifting into the skimmers.[7]In order to ensure that it dissolves properly and prevent surface deterioration, it's better to let the salt infuse gradually than to dump it in all at once.Some experts recommend adding a greater proportion of salt to the deep end around the main drain. The reasoning behind this is that the more water there is, the faster the salt will break down as it sinks.[8]\n","Use a brush to disperse salt that's settled at the bottom of the pool.\n","If you happen to notice any places where the salt has piled up, make a few passes with a long-handled pool brush to spread it out. Focus on low-lying spots, such as the area around the main drain. The motion of the brush will also encourage the salt to dissolve more rapidly.[9]If you have an above-ground pool that doesn't have a main drain, it can also help to plug a vacuum into the thru-wall skimmer input and turn the vacuum head upside down to pull water up from the bottom of the pool and keep it moving.[10]\n","Continue running your pool's filter until the salt dissolves completely.\n","For most standard-sized home swimming pools, this will take 18-24 hours, depending on the water temperature and strength of circulation. Be prepared to wait up to 48 hours for the salt to break down fully in an especially large pool.[11]Hold off on taking a dip until after the salt has had time to dissolve entirely. It isn't dangerous, but it may taste or feel unpleasant.\n","Check your salt levels again to see if they're within the targeted range.\n","The morning after you add the salt, collect another sample and drop in a fresh salt test strip. After a few minutes, note the difference in color. The shade on the test strip should match that of the ideal salinity for your pool as indicated on the product packaging.If the salinity still looks a little low, simply add more salt to bring it up to the recommended level. Once it's there, allow up to 48 hours for all of the salt to dissolve entirely.Remember that in most pools, the salt concentration needs to fall within the 2,500-4,500 PPM range to ensure proper sanitation.\n","Dilute your pool with fresh water to correct over-salination.\n","Don't worry if you accidentally add too much salt. You can correct your mistake easily by simply replacing some of the water. Set your pool to drain from the main control unit, then refill the missing water with fresh water from a nearby hose. A good rule of thumb is to drain and replace about 1/8th of your pool's water at a time until it reaches the recommended concentration.To find out how much 1/8th of your pool's total volume is, calculate the average depth in either inches or centimeters, then divide that number by 8. For a pool that's 10 feet (3.0m) deep, for example, 1/8th would be 15 inches (38cm) of water.When you're done, test the water again to make sure it's at the optimum targeted level and wait another 18-48 hours before switching on your generator.\n","Turn your generator back on when you're finished making adjustments.\n","After you've achieved the optimum salt concentration for your pool, head back down to the control unit and flip the generator switch over to the \"On\" position to restore power. It will then go to work converting the fresh salt into chlorine to sanitize the water in your pool. Happy swimming![12]You're free to dive in as soon as you get your salt chlorine generator up and running again.\n","12 Things to Consider Before Dating an Older Man\n","Guys your own age havent had a ton of life experience.\n","If you often find yourself wondering why the guys you date just want to go out and party all the time, dating an older man might be for you. If you get called an old soul a lot, youd probably have a lot in common with someone a little older.[1]Keep in mind that this is usually, not always. Even older men can be immature sometimes.\n","Older men might be more worried youre going to be unfaithful.\n","This is especially true if you still go out to bars and clubs with people your own age. If hes a jealous person, his possessive nature could become a problem in your relationship.[2]Jealous behavior can happen at any age. If your partner is controlling where you go, who you talk to, and when you can go out, it may be time to end the relationship.\n","Hes had a long time to work and save his money.\n","While guys your age might still be working for minimum wage or taking college classes, older men are more likely to have some money in the bank. Usually, they can provide for you a little better than younger men can.[3]This is another stereotype that isnt always true. Older men can definitely be in debt, and they arent always rich just because theyre old.\n","Older men have already lived out their partying days.\n","If you enjoy staying out until the wee hours of the morning, he might not always want to join you. It could turn into a point of contention if hes constantly bailing on plans or he just wants to stay home and watch TV.[4]You also might not like going out to the same places. If you prefer the club scene and he likes quiet, candlelit dinners, it could be an issue.\n","Theyve had years of experience you might not have had.\n","Generally, older men know what they like in bed (and they might know what you like, too). While guys your age are still figuring it out, an older man has already experimented enough to know what works and what doesnt.[5]On the other hand, he might be less open to trying new things with you. Older men tend to get stuck in a rut of what they like and what they dont.\n","If hes been married, theres an ex in the picture (and probably kids).\n","You might have to see his ex at family events or when they drop the kids off. Your boyfriend might also have to pay child support or share custody of his children, if he has them. Its just one more thing to consider when you think about dating an older man.[6]His ex wont necessarily be mean to you, even if they had a messy divorce. However, it is a possibility.\n","Older men tend to know what they want.\n","You probably wont have to deal with the wishy-washy what are we conversationan older man will let you know if they want to get serious or not. If thats something you want, getting in a relationship with someone older might be a good idea.[7]On the other hand, he might pressure you into taking steps you arent ready for yet (like marriage). If you arent ready to commit, it might not be the relationship for you.\n","Your friends and family members might have something to say.\n","If your relationship is getting to the point that youre introducing him to the people in your life, be prepared to defend the age gap if you need to. Well-meaning people are generally wary of large age gaps in relationships.[8]You can get people not to worry by telling them about how deep your connection is and showing them that its a loving, respectful relationship.\n","If hes close to their age, they might have a lot to talk about.\n","When you first introduce them, it might feel a little funny, but once they chat for a while, theyll probably be just fine together. If youre getting to the point that you want to bring him home to the parents, you may want to warn your mom and dad ahead of time that hes a little older.[9]\n","The age gap might come with an interest gap.\n","Maybe he likes watching movies from the 70s, while you prefer reality TV. Or maybe you like to go out and get active in nature, while he prefers lounging around the house. Relationships are built upon your common interests, so its important to have a few things you both like to do together.[10][11]Of course, this isnt all badits an opportunity for you two to teach each other about what you like to do.If you have a lot of the same values, that's more important than knowing all the same pop culture references, so don't let that hold you back if you really care about each other.[12]\n","No more job hopping for this guy.\n","If hes past his 20s, he probably knows what he wants to do and is sticking to it. Unless you find him in the middle of a mid-life crisis, hes probably got his career locked down.[13]Of course, there are some older men that find it tough to hold down a job or pick a career and stick to it. However, theyre not very common.\n","You might just be getting your life started while hes ready to retire.\n","If you want to travel the world or advance your career while he wants to move to a remote location in the woods somewhere, your relationship might have issues. Its important to talk about your long-term goals early to make sure you two are on the same page.[14]Similarly, he might be ready to settle down and start a family while youre still wanting to go out and party.\n","5 Ways to Write a Note - wikiHow\n","Choose how you are going to write these notes.\n","You have a wealth of options for writing yourself a note. You will have to decide what method works best for you to help yourself remember things.You could choose the traditional pen-and-paper method: Options here include sticky notes, a small notepad, an agenda, a journal, a diary, or a spiral-bound notebook.Alternatively, you could choose a technological method: You can try the Sticky Notes program on Windows, a notepad app on your smartphone, a reminder app on your smartphone, or your preferred online calendar, such as Google Calendar or iCal.\n","Be consistent with whatever method you chose from Step 1 above.\n","Some people find it a challenge to use one method only for notes and reminders. The problem here is that too many systems for writing yourself reminder notes gets messy and confusing.When you need a particular note to help you remember something, you will likely have no idea where it is if you use sticky notes, a calendar, a journal, and an app on your smartphone, as an example.There is no way to organize your notes to yourself when you use many different systems. You might have the urge to write something down when it is inconvenient to do so using the system you normally use for that type of thought (e.g. you always write recipe ideas down in your journal, but you get an idea when you are not at home).Your reminders and notes are simply more likely to get lost when lots of systems are involved. That may not always mean physically lost; it could also mean mentally lost (i.e. forgotten).\n","Keep your note system with you wherever you go.\n","This is easy if you choose a technological system using your smartphone, because most people have their smartphones on them at all times.

Always have that with you or know where it is so that you can access it when you need it.Keeping your notes on or near your desk is usually a pretty good idea, as that is one place you likely spend much of your day.Sticky notes work really well for some people, but they get messy quick. They also lose their stickiness eventually, causing them to fall from wherever you stuck them and potentially get lost. Keep this in mind if you use sticky notes!\n","Decide how you will leave notes for someone else, like a significant other, parent, sibling, or friend.\n","These will likely be quick notes that you use to remind them of something or to give a brief message.Using a technological tool for leaving notes likely will not work when trying to leave a note for someone else, so it is best to choose a pen-and-paper method.Always have something ready for writing notes, like a small notepad, sticky notes, or some scrap paper.\n","Clarify what your note is about.\n","As you write the note, be sure to stick to your reminder or message.Keep it short and simple.

They often start at a small base in the ground and then billow outwards. Mature elderberry plants can range from 9 to 12 feet (2.7 to 3.7m) tall.[2]Elderberry can also grow in a small, single-stem tree pattern, but that is much less common.European elderberries can grow to up to 20 feet (6.1m) tall.[3]\n","Search for elderberry in the banks of streams, marshes, or moist forests.\n","Elderberry plants love to grow in moist habitats that have a lot of drainage. If you think you are looking at an elderberry but you arent quite sure, check to see if you are near a stream or if the soil is moist or damp.[4]Elderberry is native to most of North America and Europe, and can also be found in some parts of South America.\n","Spot woody brown bark that gets harder with age.\n","New growth on an elderberry plant is smooth and brown, but it gets harder and more wood-like later on. Check large plants for woody brown bark that feels tough and is hard to bend. The oldest part of the plant will most likely be toward the base.[5]If you break a younger branch you will often find it is soft or hollow in the middle.[6]Old growth on an elderberry plant will need a tool to cut through it, like loppers or a saw.The elderberry plant can look similar to a water hemlock, but a water hemlock has a green stem with purple streaks, not woody brown bark.[7] Water hemlock is poisonous and should not be eaten.\n","Find long, pointed, light green leaves that have serrated edges.\n","The leaves of the elderberry plant are light green and can be anywhere from 2 to 5 inches (5.1 to 12.7cm) long and 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) wide. Feel the edges of the leaves to see if they are finely serrated and check for a thin point at the end of the leaves.\n","Look for groups of 5 to 11 leaves that grow opposite from each other.\n","The leaves of an elderberry plant grow in groups of 5 to 11 on 1 branch.  They grow opposite from each other, meaning that 2 leaves grow directly across the branch from each other out of the same node.[8]A cluster of 7 leaves on 1 branch is the most common.\n","Find small, white flowers with 5 rounded petals that bloom in the summer.\n","One of elderberrys most identifying traits is its flowers that bloom on the ends of branched stalks (like the head of a cow parsnip).[9] In July and August, the elderberry plant explodes in small, white-colored flowers that most often have 5 petals. They are usually in (0.64cm) wide with 5 small stamens, or long skinny stalks, at the top.[10]When in bloom, the elderberry plant creates a stark contrast between the green leaves and the white flowers.European elderberries bloom a few months earlier than American elderberries.[11]\n","Watch for flat clusters of flowers in the summer.\n","Elderberry flowers dont grow individually. Instead, they form clusters at the top of the elderberry plant that create a flat effect. From far away, these clusters can look like large, individual flowers.[12]The flat effect is created because the tops of each flower is flat. When they are grouped together, this look becomes more prominent.\n","Identify purple or black fleshy fruit in the late summer.\n","Elderberry plants produce elderberries in July and August that look rather like black currants.[13] This fruit grows in clusters of 10 to 20 and each individual fruit is less than in (0.64cm) wide. As the fruit matures, the branches will bend from their weight.[14]Red elderberry bears bright red fruit.[15]Aralia plants also bear purple, fleshy fruit that can look similar to elderberries. If the plant has spikes or thorns on the stems and branches, it is most likely an aralia plant and you should not eat the berries since they are mildly poisonous.[16]\n","How to Check Ball Joints: 7 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Look for a wear indicator.\n","While the vehicle is still on the ground, look underneath the car, on the bottom of the steering knuckle attached to the wheel. The most common indicator is a grease fitting that doubles as a wear indicator. That fitting, or boss, will stick out of the bottom of the joints housing by about half an inch (1.25 centimeters). As it wears the boss will recede into the housing. As long as the boss protrudes out, the joint should be fine. Once the boss is flush with the housing or has receded even further, youll need to replace the ball joint.This applies to older cars. Most new cars do not have wear indicators, or a grease fitting. If you cant find a wear indicator, or if the indicator doesnt give you a clear enough sign, raise up the car to inspect the joint more thoroughly.\n","Raise the front end of the car.\n","To check a loaded lower ball joint, the manufacturer will recommend that you place a jack under the lower control arm of the front wheel, as close to the ball joint as you can, then raise the vehicle until the wheel leaves the ground. If you don't do this, tension will still be on the ball joint when you jack up the car, making it difficult to move and look for play on the joint.Make sure there is no compression in the suspension when you check the ball joint. If you have control arms of unequal lengths, make sure the upper bump stop doesnt touch the control arm.\n","Rock the wheels and check for play.\n","Make sure your car is jacked securely. The vehicle must be on frame stands when jacked up and you are working on the vehicle. Move dial indicator to the side of the nut or to the side of the spindle and move the wheel in and out to check radial wear.For vertical play, place the dial indicator against the steering knuckle stud nut or the ball joint housing, depending on the manufacturer. Grab the wheel at the top and bottom (12 and 6 oclock) to lift up and pull down. Move the dial gauge to the side of the nut and grab the tire at the bottom and move it in and out to check radial play of the joint.Read the dial indicator and check against the manufacturers specifications. If the movement is beyond specifications, replace the ball joint.Experienced mechanics will also just check play by the feel, listening closely for any clicking or easy motion that suggests the ball joint is worn out. Alternatively, you could have a helper look closely at the joint itself to see if it appears loose as you move it.\n","Look for the grease fitting.\n","If your front suspension uses MacPherson struts, look for a wear indicator, which is usually a grease fitting. Grasp the fitting and try to wiggle it. If the fitting moves around inside the housing, youll need to replace the ball joint.\n","Jack up the car on the front cross-member.\n","Many front wheel drive cars with strut suspensions should not be jacked up using the lower control arm, so it's a good idea to consult your owner's manual before attempting to inspect the joint. In general, you're going to want to jack the car up in the directed place as you normally would, on the crossing member of the frame.[1]Let the MacPherson struts extend as far out as you can before you try to check the wheels for play.\n","Use your hand to check the up-down play on the ball joint.\n","Rock the lower part of the wheel around to see if there is any play in the joint. If there is any play in the joint, it must be replaced.\n","Listen.\n","The ball joint assembly in a vehicle with strut suspension should be silent.

Sometimes the object helps to stop the wound from bleeding excessively. If there is anything stuck in the wound, you should see a doctor in the emergency room immediately.[4]\n","See a doctor immediately if the cut has been caused by a human or animal bite.\n","These cuts pose a much higher risk of infection, you may need to be vaccinated for prevention, and receive antibiotics, so regardless of whether stitches are needed you should seek professional medical help.[5]\n","Consider the area of the injury.\n","If the cut is on the face, the hands, the mouth, or the genitals it is important to be seen by a doctor, as you may need stitching for cosmetic reasons and proper healing.[6]\n","Understand why stitches are used.\n","Stitches have a multitude of uses.

By pulling the edges of the wound close enough to where they can touch, stitches can help to speed healing.[9]\n","Look at the location of the wound.\n","If the open wound is located on a specific area of the body where there is a lot of movement involved, it will most likely need stitching to prevent re-opening of the wound caused by movement and stretching of the skin. For example, an open wound on the knee joint or fingers (especially where joints connect) would be eligible for stitches whereas an open wound on the thigh would not really need stitching.\n","Ask your doctor about getting a tetanus shot.\n","Tetanus shots last no longer than 10 years and then you'll have to be re-vaccinated.

This means spending less time and energy focused on the past or the future. Instead of stewing over mistakes youve made or feeling anxious over what is to come, connect to the present by connecting to your senses. Your senses are always in the moment, so more awareness of them can help you feel grounded in the here and now.[2]For example, tune into each sense, one by one. Start by listening to all the sounds around you, such as the air conditioner or traffic going by. Then, focus on your sight and drink in all of the colors, textures, and depths that surround you. Continue with each sense.\n","Meditate to detach from your ego.\n","Meditation can help you detach from the thoughts that float through your head and connect you with a feeling of peace. When you meditate, detach from your thoughts and feelings and remember that they are not who you are.[3]Do a mantra meditation where you focus on one word, such as compassion, peace, or love. this focuses your concentration externally and allows you to connect with these words.You can also do the loving kindness meditation, which places your focus on yourself and other people in your life by sending them kind and loving sentiments.\n","Practice gratitude daily.\n","Get in the habit of expressing gratitude each day. You may want to start your day by thinking of what you are grateful for or end your day by creating your gratefulness list. Write 3 things each day that you are grateful for to keep a positive approach to every day. This can also help you focus less on yourself and more on the people and things around you.[4]Start a gratitude journal to get in the habit of giving thanks daily.\n","Allow yourself to experience silence.\n","Its easy to tune into sounds all around you, whether they be noises from outside, other people, or even your own thoughts. Find a place that you can comfortably experience silence from the outside noises and inside chatter. Quiet your thoughts and just be.Silence can feel anxiety-provoking at first. Stick with it and learn to let go of the things around you, including your own thoughts and judgments.\n","Express yourself authentically.\n","Pretending youre tough or that things dont bother you is part of your ego. Find ways to express yourself through art, dance, journaling, or talking to someone you trust. Express the parts of yourself that feel most authentically you.[5]By having an outlet for expression, you can open yourself up deeply instead of hiding behind walls or pretending to be someone you are not. There are no parts of yourself that you need to shun.\n","Tell yourself you can reach your goals.\n","Your ego can trap you into thinking you cant do something or lack skills or abilities to try something new. Part of letting go of your ego means talking back to that voice that says that youll look silly or that people will think youre strange if do something different or new.If you have a voice in your head that says you cant or you shouldnt do something, dont let it keep you from your dreams.\n","Let go of fear.\n","Fear can hold you back and make you feel unworthy or undeserving. Your ego might hold onto fear, especially if you want to let it go. Confront the fears you have and be willing to take them on. Knowing that you can face things that scare you can build courage and begin to dismantle your ego.[6]Engage in activities that make you feel slightly fearful. For example, you may want to try a new food, begin a new hobby, or start dating again.\n","Develop personal insight.\n","Instead of responding as you usually do to life, think about why you think or act a certain way. Building insight into your motives, defenses, conflicts, and interactions can be done by taking a step back before you respond to something. You can also gain insight into past events by thinking about your motivations regarding your behavior.[7]For example, if you blew up at a family member this morning, ask yourself, What made me lose my temper? You might begin to realize that you feel agitated when you dont get enough sleep or when you feel rushed.\n","Recognize that your things dont define you.\n","Your ego might tell you that you have to have the nicest house, the best clothes, and the fanciest car in order to look good and keep up with those around you. If this sounds like you, remember that things dont define you and are not who you are. People generally appreciate your character and who you are over what things you have.Instead of focusing on things, focus on your character. Aim to be kind, respectful, and considerate. For example, make a point of saying, \"Hello\" and \"Good morning\" to people you pass.\n","Forgive people who have wronged you.\n","Feeling justified, angry, bitter, and resentful often stops people from forgiveness. Holding on to negative thoughts and feelings doesnt help you feel better or encourage you to let go. Consciously free yourself from these feelings by not harboring negativity toward other people. While this may not happen all at once, let go little by little.[8]Forgiveness doesnt mean you forget what happened or pretend like they didnt hurt you. Remember that forgiveness is more for you than it is for anyone else.Write a letter to a person without the intention of giving it to them. Write down the situation and why it upset you, then write that you forgive them. Symbolically release your hurt and pain by burning the letter or tearing it up.\n","Empathize with others.\n","Empathy is a way to relate to other people. Instead of focusing on yourself, you focus on what another person is thinking and feeling so that you can understand them better. Place more focus on understanding the experiences of others to build empathy.[9]For example, imagine what it would be like to live somebody elses life - with all of their circumstances - and how that would make you feel.\n","Be open to other opinions and viewpoints.\n","Youll undoubtedly meet people you disagree with or dont get along with. Instead of digging your heels in further to defend your own thoughts and opinions, hear theirs out. Listen closely and seek to understand other people. Spend less time explaining yourself and more time gaining an understanding of someone else.[10]Your ego will tell you to defend yourself or that the other persons viewpoint is invalid or stupid. Push these thoughts aside and seek to understand the differences more.\n","Stop trying to control other people.\n","If you think that you always know best for other people, recognize that this is part of your ego. Even if you disagree with someone, dont feel the need to tell them what to do or give them advice. While its nice to be helpful, dont be pushy.[11]If you want to provide your opinion or advice, first ask, Can I give you my opinion? or, Would you like some advice?\n","How to Heal Your Pancreas: 11 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Eat a healthy, low-fat diet\n",".

You can also use ethyl alcohol to extract the oils, if you would prefer. Both methods use the same basic process. To start, gather the right supplies.[1]You will need plant material in the form of herbs of flowers, depending on the type of essential oil you're making. For basil essential oil, for example, use basil herbs. For rose essential oil, use rose petals. You can find herbs or flowers at a local grocery store or florist. Make sure any flowers you use are grown organically, as pesticides may be harmful to the skin. Get a large amount of whatever herb or flower you're using, as only a small amount of essential oils can be extracted at a time.You will need two non-metal containers, such as ceramic crocks. You'll also need a strainer. You will need sealable bottles to store your mixture when you're finished.You'll need a carrier oil, like canola or olive oil. If you want to use alcohol instead, aim for ethyl alcohol. If you cannot find this, you can also use unflavored vodka.\n","Place your plant material and oil or alcohol in a non-metal container.\n","To start, pour a portion of your oils into your non-metal container. Pour enough to coat the bottom of the container, and then pour the alcohol or oil into the container. Pour just enough to cover the plant material completely.[2]\n","Set the container aside for 24 to 48 hours.\n","Find a safe place to store your container. Your container should be set somewhere where it's unlikely to be knocked over. You should keep it out of reach of children and pets. You'll be leaving the container in this place for 24 to 48 hours. If you want stronger essential oils, opt to set the container aside longer.[3]A high cabinet, which can be closed easily, is a good option if you have small children or pets.Let other household members know you're making essential oils so they know not to disturb the container.\n","Strain your mixture.\n","After the allotted time has passed, remove the container from its storage place. Take your strainer and pour the mixture through the strainer into another, similarly sized container.[4]Press the plant material lightly with your hand to squeeze out any excess liquid. This will result in more oils being released.If you're using a large container, have someone else hold the other container while you pour to make sure nothing spills.\n","Add more plant material.\n","At this point, your mixture should be giving off the scent of your chosen plant material. However, only a small amount of essential oil has been extracted so far. Rinse out the original crock and add another layer of plant material. Pour the fragrant mixture on top of the plant material.[5]\n","Repeat the process until your essential oil is at your desired strength.\n","Once again, set the container aside for 24 to 48 hours, and then strain the mixture. Repeat this until the mixture gives off a very strong scent of your chosen plant material. In general, it will take 6 to 8 rounds of treatment before you get a satisfactory batch of essential oils.[6]\n","Store correctly.\n","Once you're finished, pour the oil into one or two sealable bottles. Tighten the bottles securely and store the oils in a cool, dark place in your home.[7]Essential oils can be harmful if swallowed. If you have young children capable of opening bottles, make sure to store your oils out of their reach. You should also be careful not to store the oils out of reach of household pets, like dogs, that could chew through a container.\n","Gather the right supplies.\n","You can also extract essential oils by using steam to extract and capture the oils. You can do this using a crock pot, if you own one. To start, you'll need the following:Plant material from your chosen essential oilsA crock potA glass containerA piece of cloth\n","Fill your crockpot with distilled water.\n","Use distilled water here, to make sure your oils are not sullied by chemicals found in tap water. Fill your crock pot about halfway full, or three quarters of the way full, with water.[8]\n","Place your plant material inside the crock pot.\n","Take your chosen plant material. Place it inside the crock pot, allowing it to float on top of the water.You should use just enough plant material that it comfortably fits in the crock pot with distilled water.\n","Cook the mixture on low for 24 hours.\n","Turn the crock pot on low heat. Cover as you would when cooking meals using the crock pot. Allow it to cook on low for 24 hours.Be careful where you leave the crock pot. Crockpots cook at low temperatures, and are generally safe to leave on when your'e not home. However, make sure to keep the crock pot in a safe place away from flammable materials.\n","Allow the mixture to sit in the crock pot for another 2 to 3 weeks.\n","After the 24 hour period has passed, you can turn off the crock pot. You should also open the crock pot. Leave the mixture alone for 2 to 3 weeks to allow the oils to be fully extracted from the plants.[9]As you're leaving your crock pot open, it's important to find a safe place for it. This is particularly important if you have children or pets, as the water from the crock pot should not be ingested.A high cabinet, which closes safely, may be your best option. Let other household members know you are making essential oils and they are not to disturb the crock pot.\n","Collect the oil from the surface of the water.\n","After 2 to 3 weeks have passed, a small bit of visible oil should have risen to the surface of the water. You will want to collect this oil and transfer it to a dark, glass container.[10]You can use a cooking spoon or regular spoon to remove the oil. It may take quite a few scoops before you get all the oil. Be careful to collect only the essential oil, and not any water or plant material.\n","Cover the water with a piece of cloth and set aside for 24 hours.\n","Take your cloth and place on top of the glass container. Set the container aside for 24 hours. After 24 hours have passed, any extra water will have evaporated and your essential oils will be safe to use.As with the crock pot, it's vital that you take precaution when storing your container. Keep it out of reach of children and pets and place it in an area where it will not be disturbed.Your essential oil should last for about 12 months. Place it in a sealable container after 24 hours have passed.\n","Gather your materials.\n","You may not have a crock pot. You can also use a simple pot of water to make essential oils, although you'll need some extra material. To start, gather the following:Someone to help you, as this method requires two peopleA cotton and linen bag, as well as string to tie it shutDistilled waterA potA dark glass containerA piece of cloth\n","Put your plant material in the cotton or linen bag.\n","Take your chosen plant material and place enough of it into your bag to fill the bag. Tie the bag shut securely. Be careful to make sure the bag is tied completely shut. Pull the knots tight as you tie, and hold the bag upside and shake it to make sure no plant material escapes.\n","Place your bag in a pot of water and bring it to a boil.\n","Remember to make sure the water you're using is distilled. You do not want contaminants from tap water ruining the purity of your essential oils. Once the bag is submerged, bring the water to a boil.\n","Simmer the water for 24 hours.\n","It can get complicated to simmer the water, as you should never leave a stove on unattended. You will have to have someone help you. The two of you can take turns watching the pot as it simmers for the full 24 hour period.It's a good idea to do this on the weekends, as no one will have work obligations requiring them to wake up early.If you're watching the pot late at night, make sure you're well rested. Use coffee and other caffeinated beverages to keep you alert as you watch the pot. If you fall asleep on duty, the stove could start a fire.\n","Collect the water from the surface of the pot.\n","After the 24 hours of simmering are over, you will see some oil has risen to the surface of the water. Use a spoon to collect the oil and transfer it into a dark container. Make sure to get mostly oil and not a lot of water.[11]Squeeze the bag a little after collecting the initial oil. There may be a bit of essential oil still inside the bag.\n","Cover the water with a dark cloth and let it sit for a week.\n","Cover the dark container with a cloth. Set it aside for 24 hours, as this will allow any extra water to evaporate. After this, your essential oil should be ready. You can place it in a sealable glass container. It should last about 12 months.Be careful where you store your container for the 24 hour period. You do not want children or pets to drink the water. Keep it in a safe place, out of reach of others.\n","Accept your oils will not be as pure.\n","The major drawback to making essential oils at home is that they will not be as pure as store bought oils. Commercially made essential oils withdraw oils from plant materials using expensive equipment. Professional steaming methods, for example, require materials you would have to get from a chemistry lab. Homemade oils can be a fun project, but do not expect them to be as pure as commercially purchased oils.[12]\n","Make sure to follow all regular safety guidelines regarding use of commercial essential oils.\n","While your oils may not be as pure as store bought oils, you should follow similar safety instructions. It's better to be safe than sorry when dealing with essential oils. You should never put essential oils on your skin directly, as this can cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction. Essential oils should always be diluted in a carrier oil, like olive oil or canola oil.[13]Usually, you should aim for 3 to 10% dilution. Children, however, and people with sensitive skin should use only 1% dilutions of essential oil.\n","Consider whether making your own oils is worth the time.\n","Essential oils can take weeks to make at home. Even after the process is finished, you'll be left with a product that is not as pure as a store bought equivalent. While essential oils are pricey, the cost of the amount of plant material you'll need for certain recipes may get high. You may be better off simply buying essential oils online, especially if you do not have a lot of spare time.\n","How to Analyze Sentences (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Learn the parts of speech.\n","The words in a sentence are given names according to the type of function they serve in the sentence. There are 8 parts of speech:[1]Nouns are words that represent persons, places, or things. Examples include boy, girl, cat, dog, grass, and home.Pronouns are words that stand in for nouns so they dont have to be repeated. Examples include he, she, it, you, we, and they.Verbs are words that express action or state of being. Examples include is/are, do/does, has/have, perform, and sing. Form of verbs, called verbals, can serve as other parts of speech. Gerunds are verbals that act as nouns; they usually end in -ing (as in acting, the profession). Participles are verbals that act as adjectives; they usually end in -ing or -ed (as in melted when describing melted chocolate).Adjectives are words that describe, or modify, nouns. Examples include words representing size (big, huge, small, tiny), color (red, green, blue), quantity (one, two, three), or condition (good, bad, happy). A special group of adjectives are called articles or determiners; these include a, an, and the.Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Many adverbs end in ly (quickly, badly, really), but others do not (very, fast). They describe how, when, where, why, and how much.Prepositions are words that connect nouns to other words so they can describe those words. Examples include at, in, on, before, and after.Conjunctions are words that connect other words or parts of sentences together. Examples include and, but, and or, as well as because and when.Interjections are words exclaimed to represent outbursts of emotion or pain. Examples include hello, ouch, and oh. Interjections are followed by commas when the feeling is mild, or by exclamation points when the feeling is strong.Some words can be used as more than one part of speech, depending on where they are placed in a sentence. The word well can be used as a noun (place where water is drawn from), an adjective, an adverb, or as an interjection, for example.\n","String words together into phrases.\n","A phrase is a grouping of one or more words that conveys an idea, usually about something that exists or some type of action, and may include other words that modify it. The most important word in the phrase is called its head.[2] Some of the types of phrases are given below:A noun phrase is a phrase built around and including a noun. In the sentence The big, red dog barked loudly at the mailman., The big, red dog is a noun phrase, with dog the noun that forms the head of the phrase; the words big and red describe, or modify, it. Noun phrases can also be built around gerunds, as in loud, repeated barking.A verb phrase is a phrase built around and including a verb. In the sentence above, the phrase barked loudly is a verb phrase, with barked the verb that forms the head of the phrase; the word loudly describes, or modifies, how the dog barked.An adjective phrase is a phrase built around an adjective. In the sentence I am fond of peanut butter., fond of peanut butter is an adjective phrase with fond as its head.An adverb phrase is a phrase built around an adverb. In the sentence The mailman ran very rapidly from the barking dog., very rapidly is an adverb phrase with rapidly as its head.An appositive is a phrase that adds detail to the sentence but wont change the sentences meaning if its removed. In the sentence The big, red dog, an Irish setter, barked loudly at the mailman., the phrase an Irish setter is an appositive. Appositives are set off by commas. If the appositive is a name used to address someone, its called a vocative.A prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with a preposition and includes one or more nouns that serve as objects of the preposition. The phrase at the mailman is a prepositional phrase beginning with the preposition at and including the noun mailman as its object. A prepositional phrase typically acts as an adjective or adverb.Phrases can contain phrases of the same or different kinds within themselves. For example, the prepositional phrase at the mailman contains the noun phrase the mailman. Likewise, the adjective phrase fond of peanut butter includes the prepositional phrase of peanut butter.[3]\n","Look for phrases that form subjects and predicates.\n","To be complete, a sentence must have a word or phrase that serves as its subject and a word or phrase that serves as its predicate.The subject is a noun phrase that tells what the sentence is about. Its what does the action or experiences the state of being described in the predicate. In the sentence, The dog barked., dog is the subject, or more correctly, the simple subject. (The dog can be called the complete or entire subject.)The predicate is a verb phrase that tells the action the subject performs or the state of being the subject experiences. In the sentence, The dog barked., barked is the predicate. In a longer sentence, such as The dog barked loudly., barked is the simple predicate, while barked loudly is the complete predicate.\n","Identify the object, if there is one.\n","Some sentences also have an object, which is the part of the predicate that tells who or what received the action the subject is performing. Objects can be either direct or indirect.A direct object is one that the action was done on; it can be the answer to the question Who? or What? In the sentence, The dog gave the puppy a bone., bone is a direct object.An indirect object is one that the action was done for. In the sentence, The dog gave the puppy a bone., puppy is an indirect object. (An indirect object functions the same as a prepositional phrase beginning with the preposition to or for that could be written after the direct object, as in The dog gave a bone to the puppy.)Verbs that can be followed by an object are called transitive verbs; those that cant be followed by an object (other than the object in a prepositional phrase) are called intransitive verbs.[4]\n","Combine subjects and predicates into clauses.\n","A clause is any portion of a sentence that includes both a subject and a predicate. There are two main types: independent and dependent clauses, with dependent clauses further divided into subtypes.An independent clause can stand alone by itself as a complete sentence if all other information is removed. A sentence can have more than one independent clause; multiple independent clauses are connected with a coordinating conjunction (and, or, nor, but, so, yet) or a semicolon.A dependent clause cannot stand alone by itself but instead requires another clause to express a complete thought. (The frustrated parents reply of Because I said so is an example of an incomplete sentence made of a dependent clause.) Dependent clauses can function in sentences as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.[5]Dependent clauses may be introduced by subordinating conjunctions (although, because, if, since, unless, when, while). These kinds of dependent clauses are called subordinate clauses.Dependent clauses may be introduced by relative pronouns (who/whom/whose, what, which, that). These kinds of dependent clauses are called relative clauses.Dependent clauses that are essential to the meaning of the sentence because they limit what the sentence refers to are called essential or restrictive clauses. They are not set off by commas. In the sentence The big, red dog that lives on Pine Street barked loudly at the mailman., the clause that lives on Pine Street is a restrictive clause because it identifies a specific dog.Dependent clauses that add information that isnt essential to the meaning of the sentence are called nonessential or nonrestrictive clauses. Like appositives, these clauses are set off by commas. In the sentence The big, red dog, which is seven years old, barked loudly at the mailman., the clause which is seven years old is a nonrestrictive clause because the dogs age isnt important information.\n","Look for the subject of the sentence.\n","As noted earlier, the subject is a noun phrase (or a pronoun) that tells what the subject is about. The subject also determines the form the verb in the predicate takes.In a simple declarative sentence (statement) or exclamatory sentence (Harry threw the ball, I did it!), the subject is usually stated first.In a declarative sentence introduced with an appositive or a nonrestrictive clause (a complex sentence)[6], the subject usually appears shortly after the comma that sets off the appositive or clause. (After winding up, Harry threw the ball.)In an imperative sentence (command), the subject is usually not stated. (Bring that over here.) It is understood to be whoever the command is given to, or more simply, you.In an interrogative sentence (question), the subject can sometimes begin the sentence (Its raining in Nebraska?, Who broke this?), but it can also follow the predicate (Is this your car?) or fall between parts of it (May I have this dance?). Often, you can rewrite the question into a statement (This is your car.); in those cases, the subject of the statement is also the subject of the question.[7]A sentence can have more than one subject. Multiple subjects are called a compound subject; the individual subjects are usually connected with the conjunction and.\n","Find the verb and you find the predicate.\n","Also as noted earlier, the predicate tells what action the subject is taking or has taken or the subjects state of being. In most sentences, the predicate immediately follows the subject, while for interrogative sentences, the predicate verb usually comes before the subject.The predicate may include a main verb and a helping verb, as in I can speak German. Speak is the primary verb, but can serves as a helping verb, telling that I am able to speak German.The primary helping verbs are the forms of be, do, and have, while can is part of a group of helping verbs that expresses need or possibility, called modal helping verbs. The others are could, may, might, must, ought to, shall, should, will, and would.[8]Just as a sentence can have more than one subject, it can also have more than one predicate. Multiple predicates are called a compound predicate; the main verbs are usually connected with the conjunction and.\n","Look for the direct and indirect objects, if theyre present.\n","Objects, when present, typically follow the verb in the predicate. A verb followed by one or more objects is called a transitive verb, while a verb that isnt followed by an object is called an intransitive verb.An indirect object often follows the verb immediately, while a direct object may be preceded by modifiers or an indirect object. A sentence may have multiple direct or indirect objects.Not all nouns or pronouns that follow the predicate verb are objects, however. If the verb just connects the subject to a noun that describes it (I am a man.), the noun that follows the verb is called a predicate noun.\n","Identify modifying words, phrases, and clauses and determine what they modify.\n","Often, you can determine what words modify other words by their position in the sentence.Adjectives are usually placed before the noun they modify, whether it is the subject or the object of the sentence. If several adjectives modify a noun, they may be separated with commas if they describe different attributes of that noun.However, sentences with verbs that connect the subject with information about the subject, called linking verbs, place the adjective after the linking verb, as in the sentence He is happy. The most common linking verbs are the forms of to be (am, are, is, was, were), become, and seem, but other verbs, such as appearand feel, can also function as linking verbs.[9]Adverbs can be placed either before or after the verb they modify, but usually after. Adverbs that modify adjectives or other adverbs usually come before the word they modify.\n","Choose how much of the sentence you want to analyze.\n","Parse trees can be used to analyze a complete sentence or just a clause or phrase within a sentence.If you want to analyze an entire sentence, write the word Sentence or the abbreviation S.If you want to analyze a clause, write the word Clause or the abbreviation C.If you want to analyze a phrase, write the word Phrase or the abbreviation P. You can further define the type of phrase youre analyzing: a noun phrase (NP), a verb phrase (VP), etc.For the purposes of this example, well use the sentence The gaudily dressed Wink Martindale remains popular with long-time fans of television game shows.\n","Draw a pair of branching lines downward from the name of the component (S, C, or P).\n","The exact length of each line will vary. For a sentence with a short noun phrase as a subject and a long verb phrase as a predicate, youll need to draw a longer line for the subject and a shorter line for the predicate. If the lengths of the two phrases are about the same, your lines should be about the same length.\n","Label the ends of the branching lines.\n","Use labels according to how much of the sentence youre analyzing and the components that make that part up.If youre analyzing a complete sentence or a clause, youre looking for a subject and a predicate. Your subject will be a noun phrase, while your predicate will be a verb phrase. You can use Noun Phrase or NP to label the noun phrase as such, or Subject to label it as the subject. You can use Verb Phrase or VP to label the verb phrase as such or Predicate to label it as the predicate.In our example sentence, the subject is the noun phrase The gaudily dressed Wink Martindale, while the predicate is the verb phrase remains popular with long-time fans of television game shows.If youre only analyzing a phrase, youll only be looking for components that make up the phrase.\n","Draw new branching lines from each of the labels.\n","By drawing the new lines, youre preparing to break down the noun phrase of your subject and the verb phrase of your predicate into their components.The noun phrase The gaudily dressed Wink Martindale breaks down into an adjective phrase, The gaudily dressed, and the (proper) noun Wink Martindale, so you draw two branching lines from the label Noun Phrase or Subject.The verb phrase remains popular with long-time fans of television game shows breaks down into the verb remains and the adjective phrase popular with long-time fans of television game shows.\n","Write labels at the ends of each of the new branches.\n","The labels conform to the parts youve identified for the subject and predicate.For the branches created under Noun phrase or Subject, youd write Adjective Phrase or AdjP and Noun.For the branches created under Verb Phrase or Predicate, youd write Verb and Adjective Phrase or AdjP.\n","Repeat the branching and labeling until you have a branch and label for each word in the sentence.\n","As noted earlier, types of phrases can be broken down into smaller and smaller component phrases.The adjective phrase The gaudily dressed breaks down into the article or determiner The and the adjective phrase gaudily dressed, which, in turn, breaks down into the adverb gaudily and the participle acting as adjective dressed.The adjective phrase popular with long-time fans of television game shows breaks down into the adjective popular and the double prepositional phrase with long-time fans of television game shows. Each of the prepositional phrases breaks down into a preposition and noun phrase (with and long-time fans, and of and television game shows), and the noun phrases break down further into adjective phrases followed by nouns, and so on.\n","Write the sentence underneath the labels.\n","If youve broken the example sentence down completely, youll have this series of labels: Determiner (or Article), Adverb, Adjective, Noun, Verb, Adjective, Preposition, Adjective, Noun, Preposition, Adjective, Adjective, Noun. [10][11]You can use abbreviations: Det for Determiner, Art for Article, Adv for Adverb, Adj for Adjective, N for Noun, V for Verb, and Prep for Preposition.\n","Connect each word to the label above it with a dotted vertical line.\n","This shows the function of each word in the sentence; the tree branches show the relationships between components of the phrases that make up the sentence.[12][13]For the example sentence, youd draw a dotted line from The to Determiner (or Article), from gaudily to Adverb, from dressed to Adjective, and so on.\n","Draw a horizontal line.\n","This is the line you will write the subject and predicate of the sentence on.For most of the steps in this section, well use the same sentence as for the parse tree diagram example: The gaudily dressed Wink Martindale remains popular with long-time fans of television game shows.If you have a sentence composed of multiple independent clauses, make a line for each clause in the sentence.\n","Draw a vertical line through the horizontal line.\n","The vertical line separates the subject from the predicate.\n","Write the subject of the sentence in front of the dividing line.\n","See the step about where to look for the subject of the sentence in Part Two: Analyzing a Sentence. For this method of diagramming, we want only the simple subject of the sentence, not the complete noun phrase.For our example sentence, the simple subject is the proper noun Wink Martindale.If the sentence is an imperative (command) sentence, the subject is understood to be you. The subject is written on the line in parentheses, as (you), or as (X). If the sentence also includes a vocative (Wink, tell us the categories.), put the vocative on a horizontal line floating above the understood subject.If the sentence has multiple subjects, draw a branch (a horizontal V) from the left of the subject-predicate divider and a separate line for each subject. Write each subject on one of the lines, and connect the subject lines with a dashed vertical line. Write the word and on the dashed line.[14]\n","Write the main verb of the predicate after the dividing line.\n","If the verb has a linking verb, write it in front of the main verb.For our example sentence, wed write the verb remains after the divider.If the sentence has multiple predicates, draw a branch from the right of the subject-predicate divider and a separate line for each predicate. Write each verb and linking verb (if any) on one of the lines and connect the predicate lines with a dashed vertical line. Write the word and on the dashed line.[15]\n","Fill in the direct object, if there is one.\n","If the sentence has a direct object, it goes on the same line as the subject and predicate and is separated by a vertical line that rises upward from the subject-predicate line.Our original example sentence doesnt have a direct object. However, if our sentence were Wink Martindale gave the contestant a new car., the word car would be written after the line dividing the predicate gave from the direct object.If the sentence has one predicate but multiple objects, draw a branch from the right of the predicate-object divider and a separate line for each direct object. Write each direct object on one of the lines and connect the direct object line with a dashed vertical line on which you write and.If the sentence has multiple predicates with an object for each predicate, extend the predicate lines and draw in a vertical predicate object divider for each line, then write the objects that correspond to the predicates on the line of the predicate the object corresponds to.If the sentence has multiple predicates but only a single direct object, draw lines from each predicate line that converge at a single point. (This should mirror the branching out from the subject-predicate line, making the diagram look something like a wrapped candy.) Draw a horizontal line out from this point, with a predicate-object divider, then write the object to the right of the divider.[16]\n","Fill in the indirect object, if there is one.\n","Draw a slanting line from the predicate side of the subject-predicate line downward and to the right. Draw a horizontal line from the end of the slanting line and write the indirect object on it.Using our example sentence from the previous step, Wink Martindale gave the contestant a new car., the word contestant is the indirect object, so it would be written on the horizontal line below the predicate.If there are multiple indirect objects, draw a branch from the slanted line and a horizontal line for each indirect object. Write each indirect object on its own line and connect the indirect object lines with a vertical dashed line on which you write and.[17]\n","Fill in the predicate noun or adjective if your sentence has one.\n","A predicate noun or adjective goes in the same place as a direct object would, except that you separate it with a slanted line that points in the direction of the subject. This shows the predicate noun or adjective refers to or describes the subject.[18]In our original sentence, the word popular is an example of a predicate adjective.

The pH and chemical contents in tap water arent right for frog eggs, and the eggs will probably die.\n","Keep the tank water at 5968F (1520C).\n","In general, this is the ideal temperature for frog eggs to develop, so keep the temperature within this range. Direct sunlight makes the water way too hot and can kill the eggs, so be sure to store the tank in a shady spot.[6]Some guides say to keep the tank outside to copy the eggs natural habitat, but as long as the sunlight is right and the temperature is 5968F (1520C), they should be fine inside or outside.Temperature consistency is very important along with the exact temperature. If there are big temperature swings, the eggs could die, so keep the temperature stable.\n","Find some frog eggs from a local pond in the late winter.\n","If you have any parks near your home with ponds, these are perfect spots to look for eggs. The eggs look like big clumps of clear jelly with small black dots in the middle. Frogs usually lay eggs between February and March, so this is the best time to look.[7]It can be very difficult to tell the difference between frog and salamander eggs, even for experts. Generally, clumps of frog eggs are larger and could contain over 1,000 eggs. Salamander clumps are much smaller and only contain about 30 eggs. Salamander clumps tend to hold their shape outside of the water better than frog clumps.[8]There are some websites that sell frog eggs, but experts dont recommend doing this. These are usually non-native species that could cause problems in the local ecosystem if they escape.[9]\n","Scoop the eggs and some pond water into a plastic bag.\n","Use a small net or scooper and pick out a small clump of frog eggs. Scoop the eggs into a plastic bag. Then fill the rest of the bag with pond water to keep the eggs fresh until you get home. Seal the bag tightly so it doesnt spill.[10]Remember to only take 3-5 eggs per 1 litre (0.26USgal) of water in your tank. Scoop some back into the pond if you take too much.Its also a good idea to store the bag in a plastic container to protect it until you get home.\n","Dip the entire bag into your tank without opening it.\n","The pond temperature and your tank temperature are different, and frog eggs dont like temperature shocks. Keep the bag closed and gently drop it into the tank. It will probably float a bit near the surface. This gradually brings the eggs to the same temperature as the tank water.\n","Pour the eggs out after 2-3 hours.\n","Within a few hours, the eggs should be the same temperature as the water. Open up the bag and pour the eggs into the tank water.[11]Pour carefully so you dont spill any of the water or eggs out of the tank. If any water spills out, top off the tank so there is enough water for the eggs.\n","Move the tank into sunlight for 1 hour each day.\n","While frog eggs dont like high temperatures, they do need some sunlight to develop. Move the tank into a sunny spot for 1 hour each day, then move it back into its normal shady spot.[12]Dont forget about the tank! If you leave it in the sun all day, the eggs could die.Continue doing this after the eggs hatch, because tadpoles need some sunlight to develop too.\n","Wait 1-4 weeks for the eggs to hatch.\n","Frog eggs usually hatch pretty quickly, but might take up to 4 weeks, depending on when you gathered them. Keep the water temperature consistent and keep moving the tank into sunlight for 1 hour per day until the eggs hatch into tadpoles.[13]\n","Start feeding the tadpoles about a week after they hatch.\n","Tadpoles don't have to eat for about 24-48 hours after they hatch, and after that they'll start eating the algae that grew in the water.[14] When the algae is gone, they'll get hungry. For food, boil romaine lettuce and cut it into tiny pieces for the tadpoles to eat, or sprinkle some tadpole food pellets into the water. Feed them every 3-4 days to keep them healthy.[15]Only feed the tadpoles a little bit at a time. Wait until all the previous food is gone before putting more in for another meal.When the tadpoles grow legs, they'll start looking for meat to eat. If you were using lettuce, then either switch to tadpole food or use tiny bits of tender meat like liver for food instead.\n","Change the tank water once a week.\n","Tadpoles don't need spotless water to survive, but it should be clean. Luckily, changing the water is easy. Use a bucket and scoop out about 3/4 of the water in the tank. Fish out any tadpoles that you picked up and put them back in the tank. Then fill the tank back up with rain or pond water by pouring it in slowly.[16]If the water is cold, leave it in your home for a few hours to get the temperature to match the tank temperature.Remember to never use tap water to refill the tank. This is toxic to tadpoles.\n","Care for the tadpoles for about 12 weeks until they become frogs.\n","Continue feeding them regularly and keeping the water clean. Within about 12 weeks, you'll have a froglet, which will become a full-grown frog in a few more weeks.[17]The tadpole will first grow back legs, then front legs. You'll notice the tail get smaller and smaller until it's a small stump. The tadpoles' heads will also gradually take the shape of a frog head.\n","3 Ways to Enjoy the Super Bowl when You're Not a Football Fan\n","Head to a party for the full Super Bowl experience.\n","Just because you dont like football doesnt mean you should keep yourself from the festivities! If your friends or family are throwing a Super Bowl party, you can just go and talk to the other guests and eat some great snacks.If you dont know anyone throwing a party, host one yourself! Invite a few friends, and ask each person to bring some easy-to-share food for a low-key party.\n","Bring food to the party.\n","Easy finger foods like chips and dip or cookies are the best dishes to take along to a Super Bowl party. You could even take the ingredients to the party and make your dish there. That will diminish the time you have to spend in front of the TV. Some great snack options include:[1]Guacamole and a bag of tortilla chips.A veggie platter with carrots, celery, broccoli, cauliflower and dip.Hummus with baked pita chips.Football-shaped sugar cookies or cupcakes.\n","Spend lots of time in front of the food spread.\n","If youre not interested in the game, dont force yourself to crowd around the TV with the diehards--unless youre eager to learn! There will be plenty of people you can talk to in the back by the food and drinks. If theres no one else near you for a second, you can still look occupied by simply eating whats on your plate, or turning around for more food.\n","Talk to other people who arent into football.\n","There will probably be other people at the party who don't care about the game either, whether theyre not interested in the sport or simply arent fans of the teams playing. Theyre likely to hang out near the back or around the food. You can chat with them about the game, the food, the commercials or anything  thats going on in their life!For example, you can say something general like, This game is crazy so far. Depending on their answer, youll be able to tell if theyre not a big football fan or just dont care about the teams.If you know theyre not into football, make casual conversation about whatever you want. You could say something simple like, How was your week? or mention something about the party, like These quesadillas are so good. Have you tried them?\n","Sit at the end of the couch to make a quick getaway.\n","Try to pick a seat near the edge of the viewing area. This will make it easier to escape if you get bored. If you sit near the middle of the gathering, you might get caught up in conversation or feel stuck between others who are talking to each other through you. [2]If you do end up sitting in a good viewing spot, try to pay attention to the game. It could annoy other guests if you have a prime seat for watching the game but youre on your phone the whole time!\n","Play \"Pick a Player\" to have someone to root for in the game.\n","Write the names of the key players on both teams on small slips of paper, one player per slip. Mix them around in a bowl. Ask everyone to contribute a dollar (or more) to play, and pass the bowl around, asking each person to pick one slip of paper. The person who draws the MVP of the game (announced during the post-game celebration) wins the pot![3]Look up the key players online before the game, or ask a friend who is familiar with the teams.Its best to draw names before the game starts, but since your guests are picking at random, its okay to get a late start, too.\n","Have a game of \"Pass the Cup\" to get invested in each play.\n","Ask one guest to start by putting a dollar (or any amount you want) into an empty cup and calling out a football play, such as field goal. If the very next play is not a field goal, they pass the cup to the next person, who contributes the same amount of money and again passes it on if a field goal isnt attempted on the next play. The person holding the cup when the named play actually occurs gets the money! [4]The winner of that round gets to start the game again by choosing the next play, such as touchdown, interception, or first down, and putting in the first dollar.Dont worry if youre not familiar with many football terms. Everyone else will be watching the game closely and will definitely let you know when the named play happens!If you dont want to play with money, you can use candy, chips, or cookies.\n","Watch the commercial breaks for funny advertisements.\n","For a lot of people Super Bowl ads are the best part of the day. If you just cant get into the game, relax and chat with other guests until the commercials come on. There are lots of time outs and breaks during football games, so youll never have to wait long.\n","Play Super Bowl ad bingo to make commercials even more interesting.\n","Look online for a Super Bowl ad bingo card and print out one for each of the guests before the game. When a commercial comes on, watch closely and mark off any square that names the type of commercial that's played. Get a small prize, like a cupcake, or have each guest contribute a dollar for the winner. [5]You can also make your own bingo boards. Watch some Super Bowl ads from the last few years to get an idea of some popular themes. For example, there could be squares for puppies, car crashes, or a character crying.Make sure that the squares are arranged differently on each board so that everyone doesnt hit bingo at the same time!\n","Enjoy the halftime show for mid-game entertainment.\n","The Super Bowl halftime show is a huge performance, usually starring pop and rock stars that everyone has heard of and can enjoy. Grab a snack as the first half winds down and get a good seat around the TV. Other guests often use this time for a bathroom break, so there should be plenty of room for you!Keep watching in case guest stars pay a surprise visit on  stage (which sometimes happens!)\n","Tune in for the Puppy Bowl before the game.\n","If youre looking for something to do before the game, and if your host can get Animal Planet, Discovery Channel, TruTV, or TBS, take a look at the Puppy Bowl. It features adorable puppies rolling around on a mini football field, as well as a kitty halftime show and a human referee to maintain a little order. The show is cute and funny, and a great way to perk up your mood before the game.[6]\n","Look up basic football rules if youre unfamiliar with the game.\n","If you dont know the rules of football but want to follow some of whats going on, look up a few basic points online. You wont be an expert right away, but at least youll be able to understand some of the plays. This can also keep you entertained and focused on the game. Challenge yourself to understand the major rules before the game's over. [7]For example, youll want to know that the most important player on a team is the quarterback, who throws passes down the field or hands the ball off to the running back.The aim of the game is to get the ball into the endzone to score a touchdown, earning 6 points. A team can also kick the ball between two upright posts, scoring a field goal and getting three points.\n","Ask a good friend questions about the game.\n","If you dont mind owning up to the fact that you dont know much about football, you can just ask a friend or another guest to explain a few key points to you. Ask someone whos not too invested in the game and who wont mind taking their eyes off the screen for a few minutes to explain different points to you.Dont be nervous or embarrassed to ask questions. Your friend will probably be happy to share their knowledge and help you get enthusiastic about the game.\n","Watch how other people react, and copy them to blend in.\n","If you dont want to learn the complicated rules but would rather not stick out at a party full of football fans, just pick a team to cheer for. Look around the party to see whos supporting that team, and copy their reactions to different plays.Avoid cheering too hard, or people might ask you questions about the game that you wont know how to answer. Keep your reactions relaxed and slightly indifferent, like youre just a casual fan.For example, if your team scores a touchdown, just smile and clap, but don't pretend more enthusiasm than you really feel.If someone does ask you why youre pulling for a certain team, just say, I dont care much either way, but I just wanted to cheer for someone.\n","Know a few key players from each team (and their jersey numbers).\n","Listen to the announcers, and notice the players they talk about the most. They'll be the players on the screen most, too. You can also use your phone or computer to quickly look up the most important players on either team. You can focus on these players when theyre on the field, giving you something to concentrate on when the rest of the field gets confusing. [8]You can also mention these players in conversation to show your working knowledge of the game. Keep your comments vague, like Johnson is all over the field today, or No one can catch Simmons!The key offensive players will probably be the quarterbacks from both teams, the running backs, and a wide receiver or tight end.From the defensive side, key players are often linebackers, cornerbacks, or safeties.\n","How to Measure Commercial Square Footage: A 3-Part Guide\n","Compare measurement techniques.\n","Landlords may use several different measurement techniques to assess the square footage of a space. These methods include:Useable square footage, or USF: This is the space the tenant actually occupies. Rental agents often quote this figure to prospective renters, but it represents only part of the lease arrangement.Rentable square footage, or RSF: This is the combination of the useable square footage and a percentage of the common-area square footage of the building. Common areas, which are parts of a building all tenants benefit from, include the lobby, elevators, hallways and stairwells.Gross square footage, or GSF: The entire rentable square footage of a building.\n","Decide what method of calculating commercial space is best for you.\n","The Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) simplified industry standards for measuring rentable space in commercial buildings in 2010. The BOMA's 2 leading methods are Method B and Legacy Method A.Method B: The new Single Load Factor Method calculates the rentable space for each tenant using a uniform approach in measuring floor area. It is the same for all floor levels of a building.Legacy Method A: The 1996 standard uses separate unit prices for the USF and common square footage. In some cases, it may be beneficial for tenants to opt for this approach.[1]\n","Choose a measurement method based on the property type.\n","Typically, the measurement technique used will depend on the intended usage of the property and the planned number of tenants. Office buildings, shopping centers, and other multi-tenant buildings will typically be measured using RSF. Single-tenant buildings like warehouses or production facilities are measured using GSF. However, landlords may not be required to use a specific method to measure a space.\n","Consider regional leasing standards.\n","Federal law allows landlords to measure rentable space using any method they desire. However, certain parts of the country may have different rules for calculating square footage. Two notable examples are:The Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY) allows building owners to maximize profits by letting them bring RSF as close as possible to GSF.Tropical areas: New rules account for enclosed and open areas of commercial buildings in areas normally affected by specific weather conditions.\n","Take nothing for granted.\n","Measure the useable space yourself. A miscalculation in determining square footage can cost you thousands of dollars over the duration of the lease. Typical measurement standards allow for a 2 percent error tolerance when measuring commercial space. However, this can translate to a lot of money, especially in large or expensive spaces. Make sure to measure the area as carefully as possible, especially if you are the tenant that might be negatively affected by these miscalculations.\n","Measure simple square footage.\n","To measure commercial square footage for a rectangular space, multiply the length of the room in feet by its width. For example, a room that is 12 feet  long by 12 feet wide is 144 square feet. For L-shaped or divided spaces, you can measure rectangles of space independently and then sum the areas to get a total area measurement.Measurements may be taken using a tape measure or laser measuring device.\n","Account for unusual shapes.\n","Take care when measuring irregularly-shaped sections of a room. To conduct your measurement, try splitting the room into shapes with easy-to-calculate areas, such as rectangles and triangles. The area of a right triangle can be found by multiplying the lengths of the two non-diagonal sides (those two joined by the right angle) and then dividing the product by 2.For example, if there is a room with a diagonal wall running through it, you must use a more-complicated formula to determine the area's square footage. If the length of the space with the diagonal wall was 10 feet and its width was 8 feet, the square footage of the area would be 40 feet.That is because the wall cuts the total square footage, which would have been 80 if the room had no wall intersecting it, in half.\n","Measure common areas.\n","Common areas should be measured so that rentable square feet can be calculated. Common area square footage is measured using the same methods as usable square footage unless otherwise provided for in local laws. Common areas might include elevators, bathrooms, lobbies, stairwells, and hallways. Importantly, common areas must be available to all tenants to use or benefit from. Make sure to measure the total square footage of all common areas in the building.[2]\n","Finding gross square footage.\n","Gross square footage measures the total area of the space, including the thickness of exterior walls. To measure this area, you will need to measure wall length from the outside of the building and use those dimensions to calculate square footage. GSF is not reduced for obstructions such as ventilation shafts, support beams, or elevator shafts. GSF does not include open areas such as parking lots, pools, or unexcavated basement areas.\n","Calculate load factor for the building.\n","The load factor represents the additional percentage of square footage added to usable square footage to calculate rentable square footage. To calculate load factor, start by finding the total usable and rentable square footages of the building in questions. Remember that the usable square footage is the area that can be rented to tenants and the rentable square footage is that area plus common areas. Then, divide RSF by USF to get the load factor.[3]For example, if a building has 80,000 square feet of usable space and an additional 20,000 square feet of common areas, the rentable square footage would be 100,000.Then, the load factor would be calculated as 100,000 / 80,000 = 1.25.\n","Finding rentable square footage for a property.\n","The rentable square footage for a property can be calculated using the building's load factor and USF of the property. The load factor is multiplied by the USF to get the RSF. You can then use the RSF and price per square foot to figure out the monthly rent.[4]Continuing with the previous example, imagine that the property is divided in half between two commercial spaces. So, each one has 40,000 square feet of usable space.To find RSF, multiply this amount by the load factor, which is 1.25. This means that the RSF in this case would be 40,000 x 1.25 = 50,000.\n","Weigh the differences in commercial properties.\n","Unit prices can vary widely based on the location and class of the building. The rent on a 500 square foot (46.5 square m) office downtown might run higher than the rent on a 1,000 square foot space (92.9 square m) only 10 blocks away. Buildings fall into 1 of 3 standard classifications.Class A: These are the most prestigious buildings in the most-exclusive sections of a city.  Class A buildings command higher rents than average.Class B: This is the broadest classification. Most of these buildings have fair to good finishes.Class C: Units in this class are highly functional but offer few amenities. Rents are generally low.[5]\n","Calculate total rent for a property based on square footage.\n","Rents are typically based on a space's RSF or GSF. Once you have this data, you can use the market price per square foot to determine a rent price for the property. Continuing with the example above, if rent were $1.50 per square foot of RSF per month, the rent would be $1.50 x 50,000 = $75,000.[6]\n","How to Cure Piles Naturally: 11 Home Remedies\n","Avoid medicinal laxatives.\n","Laxatives can be habit forming and can also weaken the bowels, potentially leading to chronic constipation.[1]Instead, use dietary changes and herbal supplements to stimulate your bowels, if necessary.\n","Take a Sitz bath.\n","Sitz baths technically only have a few inches of water to soak the anus but if you prefer a full bath, it can accomplish the same thing. If you prefer the traditional Sitz bath, just fill the tub with a few inches of water or buy a Sitz bath at any pharmacy or medical supply store. Some of the commercial bags come with tubing and vents to allow water to constantly circulate.  These provide a constant supply of water that is useful but not essential; the same effects can be accomplished at home using the tub. These baths allow for better circulation in the anal area and for relaxation and healing of the tissues around the anus.[2][3]Add about one cup of epsom salts to a full bathtub or two to three tablespoons of epsom salts for a few inches of water in the tub. Keep the water warm, but not too hot. Repeat two to three times a day.Fill your bathtub with about 6 inches (15 cm) of warm water and add a handful of Epsom salt to the mix, stirring it up so it dissolves. Now sit in the bathtub with your knees flexed for fifteen minutes. Flexing the knees will expose your anus to the water and the warm water will soothe the pain and the inflammation.\n","Try a warm compress.\n","Get a clean, cotton wash towel and soak it in warm (but not hot) water. Apply the compress for about 10 to 15 minutes, directly on the pile.  Repeat four to five times a day.[4]\n","Use ice.\n","Ice packs can help reduce the swelling of piles. You can use already-made ice packs or place some ice into a plastic bag and wrap in a piece of cloth. Place it onto the hemorrhoid region.[5]Only use ice packs for five to ten minutes at a time. Do not apply ice directly onto skin as doing so could produce harmful effects (such as frostbite).\n","Use unscented moistened wipes.\n","Maintaining hygiene is important for someone who is suffering from hemorrhoids because it prevents complications from forming, such as infection or blistering of anal mucosa due to excessive dryness. To prevent such complications, one may use unscented cotton wet wipes, often called \"baby wipes\" (can be purchased in many common types of stores) to gently wipe the anal region after every bowel movement. After a Sitz bathand in generalavoid wiping with regular toilet paper or hard towels. Only use soft and gentle methods of cleaning. A baby wipe is an effective and soothing product.In addition, avoid perfumed or colored toilet paper. Although they may seem pleasing, the chemical additives that create scent and color can cause local irritation on the body.\n","Apply an astringent to the affected area.\n","Pharmaceutical witch hazel is a naturally-derived antioxidant and astringent, which can help soothe engorged hemorrhoids and make them feel less sore, and may significantly help to reduce itching of piles.[6] Witch hazel can be applied directly--gently and in moderate amounts--with cotton swabs or cotton pads; soaked pads can be bought in stores. However, know that witch hazel and other astringents will likely need to be avoided in the presence of auto-immune disorders such as moderate to severe dermal sensitivity (i.e. rosacea, eczema), and, of course, allergy to a substance in question; always consider your overall health and other known or suspected health conditions before using medicinal products. Repeat as often as needed. Try to apply witch hazel at least 4 to 5 times a day.Warm olive oil is an alternative to witch hazel. Olive oil will additionally remedy the dryness of the affected area as it is a rich lubricant containing antioxidants. For non-dietary use, choose non-virgin oil for lower price and better resource allocation.Warm, wet tea bags can also be used to soothe pain in the anal region. Tea contains a natural astringent which helps to reduce swelling, while the warmth of the tea bag can relieve pain. Before use, ensure that the tea (not \"tisane\") bag is not hot.\n","Try pain- and itch-relieving topical applications.\n","After a bath and fully drying off, use a small amount of aloe vera gel or Preparation H ointment to help with hemorrhoidal pain and discomfort. Apply as often as needed (also consult directions and ingredients written on labels). Aloe vera gel contains components that have been shown to inhibit infection and help in healing minor wounds. You can use the gel straight from an aloe plant by taking a large leaf and cutting it open to release the gel. Alternatively, you can purchase 100%  natural aloe vera gel from a drug store.Preparation H ointment, available in most grocery stores, contains petroleum jelly, mineral oil, shark liver oil and phenylephrinephenylephrine acts as a decongestant and helps shrink the hemorrhoid.\n","Extract and apply vegetable juice.\n","Beetroot and carrots can be crushed to extract their juice. A thick piece of cotton or a large piece of gauze can be soaked with the juice and applied on the swollen veins. Initial research has shown beetroot can reduce high blood pressure and might help reduce swelling of the engorged hemorrhoids.[7]\n","Consider taking herbal supplements.\n","There are different types of herbs that can act as natural laxatives. Some good options include:Senna: A natural and gentle stool softener. You can take senna as tablets (following manufacturers instructions) or as a nightly tea.[8]Psyllium: A natural bulking and softening agent. Adults can take between 1/2 and 2 teaspoons of psyllium (such as Metamucil) in 8 ounces of water once daily. The psyllium should be added to the water, stirred and drunk immediately (the mixture thickens quickly). You may want to start with 1/2 teaspoon and increase the dose by 1/2 teaspoon the next day if passing stool is still uncomfortable.Flaxseed: Add as a bulking agent to foods such as cereals, salads, soups and smoothies. Adding 2 to 3 tablespoons of flaxseed daily can ease the passage of stools.[9]\n","Explore other natural relief remedies.\n","You might have a few things in your kitchen that you didn't know could help with piles. Here are some ideas:Bitter gourd leaves, when crushed, can be applied locally to relieve the pain caused by piles.[10]Baking soda can be applied as a powder or as a paste on the swollen veins (use 1 tablespoon of baking soda and mix with water). Make sure to only leave it on for 15 minutes as the paste could dry out the area and worsen the situation.[11]About 5 milliliters of the latex or juice of the banyan tree, when added to a serving of milk and consumed once daily (especially in the morning), is beneficial for patients with piles.A mixture of ginger and honey, boiled to make a decoction (an extraction through boiling) and then spiced with a dash of sweet lime and mint leaves helps detoxify the body and cool the body system. It will ensure a good blood supply to the piles.3 teaspoons of honey boiled with 2 teaspoons of pepper and 2 teaspoons of fennel along with 500 millimeters of water makes an excellent decoction that can be consumed over the day.\n","Use essential oils.\n","Essential oil must be diluted in carrier oil before applying to skin. To create a dilution, add 2 to 4 drops of a chosen essential oil to 2 fluid ounces (59.1ml) of a base, such as jojoba oil, castor oil, almond oil or avocado oil. Mix well and apply directly to external piles. Use 1 essential oil or up to 2 to 3 in a mixture.[12]Lavender oil can help relieve pain and itching.Cypress oil is used to soothe and help in healing tissue.Tea tree oil is an antiseptic and is anti-inflammatory.Avocado oil can be used as a base or added to other oils. It moisturizes, soothes and accelerates healing.\n","Eat more fiber.\n","Preventing difficult or straining bowel movements by softening the stool is a major method of both preventing and getting rid of piles. Fiber is very important in this regard. It helps keep water in the stool and bulks it up so that the stool passes through the rectum and anus more easily and, in the case of hemorrhoids, with less pain. (Note: determine ingredient sensitivity and allergy prior to following any consumption advice.) Good sources of fiber include:[13][14]Whole grains, including brown rice, barley, corn, rye, bulgur wheat, kasha (buckwheat) and oatmeal. (Note: consuming grain while having auto-immune disorders or sensitivity to gluten or starches can cause bloating, cramping, diarrhea, intestinal damage and other ailments.)Fruits, especially cherries, blueberries, plums, prunes, apricots, raspberries and strawberries.Vegetables, such as leafy vegetables like Swiss chard, collard greens, spinach, lettuce, beet greens.Beans and legumes. (Note: eating beans and legumes can increase intestinal gas.)\n","Drink more water.\n","An adequate consumption of water cannot be emphasized enough. A minimum of 8 to 10 8-ounce servings per day is recommended. Sufficient water intake helps keep bowel movement soft and keeps organs properly hydrated and lubricated.[15]\n","Get more vitamin C.\n","Vitamin C can tone and shrink veins, keeping them from becoming lax, prolapsing, or bleeding easily. Vitamin C along with anthocyanins helps keep your veins strong and can protect against straining or tearing in the anus.[16]Citrus and other fruits often also contain bioflavonoids, which help strengthen your veins. Fruits rich in flavonoids are lemons and limes, apples and tomatoes. Anthocyanin-rich foods include onions, red cabbage and carrots and fruits like berries, grapes and cherries. (Note: most of the aforementioned foods in this section are noted cautionary items in auto-immune diet protocols, and they can disrupt digestion, blood pressure and immune response in sensitive individuals with compromised auto-immunity.)All varieties of berries, owing to their anti-inflammatory properties and being rich in vitamin C and flavonoids, ensure smooth passage for the stool. They're also excellent sources of antioxidants.\n","Try drinking more vegetable juices.\n","Drinking beetroot juice has shown to reduce blood pressure by about 2% and may be helpful in reducing the swelling of hemorrhoids. You might try having a glass each week or eat a boiled beetroot each day for a month and see if you notice the difference.Alternatively, radish juice is one of the best options to flush out the toxins from the body as well as ensure that the stool passes through without any pain and discomfort. One must be careful with the quantity consumed, as  cup of radish juice once a day is more than enough. More than  a cup can aggravate the symptoms. A little juice of turnip leaves can also be added to the radish juice or can be had by itself too.\n","Know what foods to avoid.\n","Piles can easily be aggravated by certain foods. For example, heavily seasoned food with spices and chilies must be avoided at all costs as it can greatly increase the discomfort and bleeding of piles.[17]Processed food, canned food, and food with preservatives should also be avoided as they are very low in fiber and typically contain chemical additives that can aggravate the condition of piles. [18]Fatty or deep fried food like meat, fast food, and french fries can also intensify the symptoms of piles due to their poor fiber, high-fat content and chemical additives involved.\n","Dont strain.\n","Straining is one of the main causes of hemorrhoids. Allow gravity to help, but let your bowels do most of the work.  If nothing happens, put it off for an hour or so, but most importantly, dont strain![19][20]\n","Try to routinize your bowel movements.\n","See if you can arrange a regular time to use the bathroom without interruptions. Regular bowel movements at around the same time every day tend to make bowel movements easier. Moreover, having regular bowel movements is a great predictor of overall good health.[21][22]Use baby wipes to clean yourself after a bowel movement.[23]\n","Wear cotton underwear.\n","If you suffer from piles or hemorrhoids you should use 100% cotton underwear. Cotton is very gentle on the skin, which means it will minimize any irritation that you may feel from other materials such as polyester or silk. Cotton prevents itching in the piles, is absorptive and gentle on the sensitive piles.[25]Avoid wearing thongs which may irritate the tissue surrounding the piles.\n","Exercise\n",". The exercise can be aerobic, endurance, cardiovascular or just walking. The idea is that body movement can help keep your bowels moving by essentially massaging them. In other words, as your body moves, your internal organs move and get massaged as well. This can help with circulation to the piles and also help keep your bowels regular in general. It is essential that a healthy circulation be maintained in the piles, which are nothing but engorged anal veins. If the blood supply reduces, they might become gangrenous and lead to an emergency.\n","Avoid sitting for long periods of time.\n","Not sitting for long periods of time can be beneficial for people who suffer from hemorrhoids. Sitting can actually develop excessive intra-abdominal pressure and may aggravate the hemorrhoids. If you have a desk job, get up every hour and go for a short walk. [26]Find a foam cushion or a doughnut cushion (a coccyx cushion) to sit on if you do need to sit for a bit of time. This can help relieve some of the pressure.\n","Cut back on alcohol\n",". Alcohol is one of the first things you should cut down on because it dehydrates you and causes your stools to be hard. Alcohol use can negatively affect piles and will not only hamper the chances of recovery but can increase the bleeding as well. It has been proven that prolonged use of alcohol leads to portal hypertension (swelling of the liver) and hemorrhoids.[27]Try to limit yourself to a maximum of one to two drinks per day. This is the recommended amount, but you might want to try to drink even less than that if you are currently battling piles.\n","See your doctor immediately if you experience bleeding.\n","Although this may not be a cause for concern, its always best to see a doctor if you have rectal bleeding. Your doctor will make sure you dont have another condition, and theyll check that your hemorrhoids arent at risk for infection.[28]Your doctor may prescribe you something to relieve the cause of your bleeding.\n","Check with your doctor for chronic hemorrhoids or if they persist longer than 4-7 days.\n","Although hemorrhoids are normal, you may need a doctors care if theyre becoming frequent or dont go away with home treatment. You may need to make some changes to your diet or lifestyle, which your doctor can help you identify. Additionally, your doctor may recommend using a cream or ointment to relieve your symptoms.[29]\n","Get a diagnosis with a physical exam.\n","In most cases, your doctor can quickly and easily diagnose hemorrhoids by just looking at the area. Additionally, theyll ask you questions about the symptoms youve been experiencing and how long theyve been happening.[30]If you may have hemorrhoids inside your rectum, your doctor may use their gloved finger to check. This is often simple and quick.[31]\n","Consider medical treatments if nothing else helps.\n","Most hemorrhoids go away on their own, but you may consider other options if yours wont go away with home treatment. If your hemorrhoid is very large or painful, ask your doctor about your options. They may recommend one of the following treatments to help you find relief:[32]Creams, Ointments, or Suppositories: These treatments are often available over-the-counter at your pharmacy. However, your doctor can also prescribe you a stronger version.Banding: This is a simple procedure where your doctor puts a tight elastic band at the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off the blood supply. After a few days, your hemorrhoid should fall off.Surgery: While youre under anesthesia, your doctor can remove or shrink a large hemorrhoid.\n","How to Treat a Heart Attack: 8 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Understand that sometimes there are very subtle or no warning signs.\n","Some heart attacks are sudden and intense and provide no warning signs or tell-tale symptoms. However, in most cases, there are at least subtle clues that usually get rationalized or marginalized. Early warning signs of heart disease include high blood pressure, sensation of chronic heartburn, reduced cardiovascular fitness, and a vague feeling of malaise or being unwell. These symptoms may start many days or weeks before the heart muscle gets damaged enough to become dysfunctional.[1]Symptoms in women are particularly hard to recognize and are ignored or missed even more often.Major risk factors for heart disease, heart attack, and stroke include: high blood cholesterol levels, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cigarette smoking and advancing age (65 years and older).A heart attack doesn't always lead to cardiac arrest (complete heart stoppage), but cardiac arrest is always indicative of a heart attack.\n","Recognize the most common symptoms of a heart attack.\n","Most heart attacks do not occur suddenly or \"out of the blue.\" Instead, they typically start slowly with mild chest pain or discomfort that builds over many hours or even days. The chest pain (often described as intense pressure, squeezing or achiness) is located in the center of the chest and can be constant or intermittent. Other common symptoms of a heart attack include: shortness of breath, cold sweats (with pale or ashen skin), dizziness or lightheadedness, moderate-to-severe fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain and a sensation of severe indigestion.[2]Not all people who experience heart attacks have the same symptoms or the same severity of symptoms  there's lots of variability.Some people also report feeling a sense of \"doom\" or \"impending death\" that is unique to the heart attack experience.Most people experiencing a heart attack (even a mild one) will collapse to the ground, or at least fall against something for support. Other common causes of chest pain don't typically lead to sudden collapse.\n","Recognize some of the less common symptoms of a heart attack.\n","In addition to the tell-tale symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and cold sweats, there are some less common symptoms characteristic of myocardial infarction that you should be familiar with in order to better gauge the probability of heart failure. These symptoms include pain or discomfort in other areas of the body, such as the left arm (or sometimes both), mid-back (thoracic spine), front of the neck and/or lower jaw.[3]Women are more likely than men to experience less common symptoms of heart attack, particularly mid-back pain, jaw pain, and nausea/vomiting.Other diseases and conditions can mimic some of the symptoms of heart attack, but the more signs and symptoms you experience, the greater the likelihood your heart is the cause.\n","Call emergency services\n","immediately. Act immediately and call 9-1-1 or other emergency services in your area if you suspect someone is having a heart attack. Even if they don't display all or even the majority of the signs and symptoms, calling for medical help is the most important action you can take for someone in severe distress. Emergency medical services (EMS) can begin treatment as soon as they arrive and are trained to revive someone whose heart has completely stopped.[4]If you can't call 9-1-1 for some reason, ask a bystander to call and give you updates as to the estimated arrival of emergency services.Patients with chest pain and suspected heart attack who arrive by ambulance usually receive faster attention and treatment at hospitals.\n","Put the person in a seated position, with knees raised.\n","Most medical authorities recommend sitting a suspected heart attack sufferer down in the \"W position\"  semi-recumbent (sitting up at about 75 degrees to the ground) with knees bent.[5] The person's back should be supported, perhaps with some pillows if at home or against a tree if outside. Once the person is in the W position, then loosen any loose clothing around his neck and chest (such as his necktie, scarf, or top buttons of his shirt) and try to keep him still and calm. You may not know what's causing his discomfort, but you can reassure him that medical help is on its way and that you'll stay with him at least until that point.The person should not be allowed to walk around.Keeping a person calm while having a heart attack is certainly a challenge, but avoid being too chatty and asking lots of irrelevant personal questions. The effort required to answer your questions may be too taxing to the person.While waiting for emergency help, keep the patient warm by covering him with a blanket or jacket.\n","Ask the person if she carries nitroglycerine.\n","People with a history of heart problems and angina (chest and arm pain from heart disease) are often prescribed nitroglycerine, which is a powerful vasodilator that causes large blood vessels to relax (dilate) so more oxygenated blood can reach the heart.[6] Nitroglycerine also reduces the painful symptoms of a heart attack. People often carry their nitroglycerin with them, so ask if that's the case and then assist the person in taking it while waiting for emergency personnel to arrive. Nitroglycerin is available as little pills or a pump spray, both of which are administered under the tongue (sublingually). The spray (Nitrolingual) reportedly is faster acting because it's absorbed quicker than the pills.If unsure of the dosage, administer one nitroglycerine pill or two pumps of the spray under the tongue.After administration of nitroglycerine, the person may become dizzy, lightheaded, or faint soon after, so make sure she is secured, sitting down, and not in danger of falling and hitting her head.\n","Administer some aspirin.\n","If you or the heart attack sufferer has any aspirin, then administer it if there's no indication of allergy. Ask the person if he has an allergy and look for any medical bracelets on his wrists if he has trouble talking. Provided he is not younger than 18 years old, give him a 300 mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly.[7] Aspirin is a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can reduce heart damage by \"thinning\" the blood, which means preventing it from clotting. Aspirin also reduces associated inflammation and helps reduce the pain of a heart attack.Chewing the aspirin allows the body to absorb it faster.Aspirin can be taken concurrently with nitroglycerine.A dose of 300 mg is either one adult tablet or two to four baby aspirins.Once at the hospital, stronger vasodilating, \"clot-busting,\" anti-platelet and/or pain-relieving (morphine-based) drugs are given to people experiencing heart attacks.[8]\n","Initiate CPR if the person stops breathing.\n","Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) involves chest compressions in order to help push some blood through the arteries (especially to the brain) combined with rescue breathing (mouth to mouth), which provides some oxygen to the lungs.[9] Keep in mind that CPR has its limitations and doesn't usually trigger a heart to start beating again, but it can provide some precious oxygen to the brain and buy some time before emergency services arrive with their electrical defibrillators. Regardless, take a CPR class and at least learn the basics.When someone starts CPR before emergency support arrives, people have a better chance of surviving a heart attack or stroke.People not trained in CPR should only do chest compressions and avoid rescue breathing. If the person doesn't know how to effectively deliver rescue breathing, they will simply be wasting time and energy by improperly administering breaths that are not effective.Keep in mind that time is very important when an unconscious person stops breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after four to six minutes without getting oxygen, and death can occur as soon as four to six minutes after enough tissue is destroyed.[10]\n","How to Make a Windows XP Bootable Disk Using a ISO File: 9 Steps\n","Download PowerISO, And install it.\n","You might have to restart your computer after the installation.\n","Double click on your ISO file you want to burn.\n","\n","Click on Burn.\n","\n","Click on Burn again.\n","\n","Use the CD drive to boot from the CD.\n","\n","Download PowerISO, and install it.\n","\n","Right click on the ISO file you want to mount.\n","> Go to PowerISO> Set number of drives> For example 1 drives.\n","Right click on your ISO file you want to mount.\n","> Go to PowerISO> Mount IMG to drive [Letter] >\n","Go to My Computer.\n","You will see your mounted CD.\n","How to Care For a Mother Hamster and Her Babies: 10 Steps\n","Prepare the mother for birth.\n","If you know the mother is pregnant ahead of time, you can work on preparing her for birth. You can tell a hamster is pregnant if she has gained weight and is engaging in nesting behaviors, such as piling wood shavings and other material in one corner of the cage.[1] Clean her cage and replace all wood shavings or other substrate with clean supplies.[2]You should also remove wheels and toys to prevent injury to the babies.Place toilet paper somewhere in the cage so the mother can build a nest.Give the mother slightly extra food than usual.\n","Scatter food for the mother to bring the babies.\n","You do not need to worry about feeding newborn hamster babies yourself. The mother hamster will nurse her babies for the first two to three weeks and then she will feed them by bringing them scattered food from around the cage. Scatter pellets and other hamster food throughout the cage and allow the mother to forage for food to feed the babies.[3]As the babies age, you will see they begin to explore the cage and hunt for food themselves.\n","Check the cage frequently.\n","Once the babies are born, it's vital to make sure there is enough food and water to go around. The water dish or bottle should be full at all times and there should always be plentiful food scattered on the floor for the mother to bring the babies. Check the cage frequently throughout the day to make sure no supplies have run out.[4]Be quiet when checking the cage. While it's important to keep the hamsters well fed, you want to make sure you don't disturb the mother. Peace and quiet is important for the first few weeks.\n","Avoid touching the babies until they've grown fur.\n","A mother may be protective of her babies and dislike having your smell on them. When the babies are very young and have not grown much fur, refrain from touching them as much as possible. Usually, it's safe to touch the babies after 10 to 14 days. At this point, they have plenty of fur, their eyes are open, and they're eating solid food.\n","Encourage naturally weaning by providing an adequate supply of food.\n","Weaning usually begins at two to three weeks. The babies will eventually transition naturally to solid food as their mother discourages them from nursing. Providing enough food during this time can help the process run smoothly.[5]Provide pellets for the hamsters, adding bowls for each baby.Make sure to check the cage frequently during this time to make sure the babies have enough food.\n","Separate baby hamsters from their mother after 21 to 28 days.\n","After three to four weeks, hamsters are generally old enough to be separated from their mother. If babies are left with their mothers for too long, the mother will start becoming aggressive.You should separate the male and female hamsters to prevent inbreeding. In general, hamsters of the same gender should be able to share a cage. However, if fighting occurs frequently, you may have to separate the hamsters.\n","Determine the sex of the babies.\n","You need to make sure you do not pair hamsters of the same sex together. Hamsters reach sexual maturity quickly and you do not want siblings breeding with one another.[6]Carefully pick up the babies and look just under their tails. Hamsters have two distinct openings in this area.Males have openings that are slightly apart. Females have openings with no space in between.\n","Make sure there's enough food and water.\n","It is vital to keep the food and water supply plentiful, especially just after the mother gives birth. If the mother feels resources are scarce, she may kill her babies to spare them from starvation. Be proactive about filling food and water bowls in the cage.\n","Keep the cage dry.\n","A wet cage can be deadly for baby hamsters. If a water bottle leaks or a water bowl spills, clean up the water quickly. Add fresh bedding to the cage promptly and remove any wet or soiled bedding.\n","Refrain from cleaning the cage early on.\n","Unless you need to clean up a water spill, leave the cage alone when the babies are first born. You should not clean the cage until about two weeks have passed or when the babies have opened their eyes.[7]\n","How to Do Undercut Hair for Women: 11 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Inspect your hair's texture.\n","Before going for an undercut, its important to consider your hairs texture. An undercut removes some of the weight and body from your hair so its an ideal option for thick, coarse hair that can sometimes get too puffy.[2]If you have fine or thin hair, you may want to reconsider choosing an undercut. It can actually make your hair appear thinner and take away the body.An undercut can be a good style for big, curly hair because it can take out some of the bulk.\n","Decide how deep your want the undercut to be.\n","An undercut can be as subtle or as deep as you like, depending on how short you cut the hair. Take the length of the rest of your hair into account. The shorter that your hair is overall, the shorter you can go with the undercut without creating too big a contrast. With long hair, you may want to keep the undercut a little longer for a more subtle look. If you want to ease your way into an undercut, keep it at 13- to 16-mm. For a bolder undercut, go for 6- to 10-mm.[3]When youre trying an undercut for the first time, its best to go for a longer cut. You can always go shorter, but youll have to wait for your hair to grow out if you cut it too short to begin with.\n","Determine how large an area you want to undercut.\n","In addition to the length or depth, the size of your undercut also determines how dramatic your look will be. If youre getting your first undercut, its best to keep the area that you cut fairly small. However, if you want a bold look, you may want to use a larger area for the undercut so more of it peeks out.[4]In general, most undercuts involve the nape area of the head. The line of your natural part serves as the border. This type of undercut is usually only visible if you pull your hair up unless your overall haircut is very short.For the most dramatic undercut, you can cut the two bottom sections or even leave just the top section out and cut all of the lower layers. Keep in mind that if you do drastic undercuts like these, your shorn hair will be visible most of the time.\n","Set up in front of a large mirror.\n","If you're doing the undercut to yourself, you're going to need to be able to see the back of your head so you know where you're cutting. Sit down in front of a large wall-mounted mirror to do the cut and have a medium-sized hand mirror available that you can hold up to the back of your head so you can see it in the wall mirror.[5]\n","Pull up the top section(s) of your hair.\n","To get ready for the haircut, you want to pull all of the hair that you arent cutting out of the way. Run your thumbs behind your ears to lift up the top sections of your hair, twist it to create a single rope of hair, and secure it with a clip so only the area of hair that you plan to cut is left down.[6]Make sure that there are no stray hairs from the upper sections of your hair that have fallen loose. You may accidentally wind up cutting them, and your undercut will turn out uneven.\n","Create a straight part above the nape of your neck where you plan to cut.\n","For the neatest looking undercut, you want to make sure that the part between it and the rest of your hair is as straight as possible. Use the end of a teasing comb to trace along the natural part and lift out any small piece of hair that should be part of the upper sections of your hair.[7]You dont necessarily have to use a straight part for the top of the undercut. For example, you may prefer a zigzag pattern to add more flair to your cut. However, youll want to start with the straight part and use the clippers to cut the design into your hair.[8]\n","Place a headband at the part to serve as a guide.\n","Once youve secured the top sections of your hair out of the way and ensured that your part is straight, youll still want to have a guide when you begin cutting. Place a headband right along the bottom edge of the top sections of your hair. That will block off the section of hair that you are cutting so you dont cut any hair that you shouldnt.[9]Any type of headband that will stay in place on the back of your head without you having to hold it will work fine.\n","Cut the major length off.\n","If your hair is fairly long in the back, it can be difficult to take all of the necessary hair for the undercut off with your clippers. Instead, use a pair of hair-cutting shears to cut off the major length from the designated area so you can just go with the clippers to buzz off the rest.[10]Dont wet your hair before you cut it. Its usually easier to do when its dry.\n","Place the appropriate blade on your hair clippers.\n","Most clippers come with several different blades that allow you to control how short you clip your hair. Even if youre going for a super short undercut, you may want to start with a blade that keeps your hair longer and then switch to a closer blade to finish off the look so you dont take off more than you want.[11]The grade 2 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 6-mm.The grade 3 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 10-mm.The grade 4 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 13-mm.The grade 5 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 16-mm.The grade 6 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 19-mm.The grade 7 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 22-mm.The grade 8 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 25-mm.\n","Trim the hair with the clippers to your desired length.\n","Once youve chosen the appropriate blade for your clippers, run them over the section of hair that you want to cut in an upward direction to just below the headband to remove it. Move the clippers over the entire section once and then go back in to cut the hair shorter if necessary.[12]It helps to keep your free hand braced on the headband so it stays in place and you dont accidentally cut off more hair than you intend.\n","Switch to a shorter blade to finish the cut.\n","After youve removed the bulk of your hair, you may find that its not quite as short as youd like. Swap the blade on your clippers for the next smallest size, and go over the hair a second time to finish it off.[13]Dont panic if you wind up cutting your hair a little too short. It will grow in fairly quickly, and if youve only removed the lowest section of hair, it will be fairly subtle.\n","How to Learn Welding: Skills & Resources\n","Welding is the process of fusing two or more materials with high heat.\n","Welding can be performed on metal, thermoplastics, and even wood to make one unified piece.[1] It is often used to construct buildings, bridges, vehicles, and art, like metal sculptures. There are many different types of welding, including:[2]MIG WeldingStick or Arc WeldingTIG WeldingPlasma Arc WeldingElectron Beam and Laser WeldingGas WeldingAtomic Hydrogen WeldingOxy-Acetylene Welding\n","Stick or MIG welding are beginner-friendly options.\n","Gas Metal Arc welding (MIG) and Stick welding, also called Arc welding, are the two most common and affordable welding methods. MIG consists of two types of welding; the first type uses bare wire, while the second uses flux core to join thin pieces of metal together. Meanwhile, Stick welding is considered the old fashioned way of doing things, as it uses a stick electrode welding rod to join pieces together.[3]If youve already taken a course or class, stick with the welding technique and machine youve already used.\n","Auto-darkening welding helmet\n","The light that welding gives off is incredibly bright and can cause permanent damage to your eyesight. In addition to protecting your eyes, a full-face welding helmet will prevent sparks and metal debris from being shot into your face as you weld. Never weld a piece of metal without having full face and eye protection first.[4]An auto-darkening welding helmet will prevent you from having to lift your helmet when you stop welding.\n","Heavy-duty welding gloves\n","Thick leather welding gloves protect your hands from getting burnt while you weld. Before you purchase welding gloves, determine the kind of welding you want to do, then purchase gloves made specifically for that style. This information is typically found in the product description or within the product's name.[5]For instance, MIG welding gloves are often thicker and provide less hand mobility than TIG welding gloves.\n","Fire-resistant leather apron\n","Buying a leather apron thats made for welding will protect your clothes and body from getting burned. Under your apron, wear a long-sleeved shirt with buttoned or closed cuffs, long pants, and closed-toe shoes or boots.[6]\n","Welding machine\n","Search online for different welding machines and read customer reviews to find a reliable brand and model you can purchase. Stick welders are typically the cheapest, while MIG welders are more expensive on average. Once you determine which machine you want, order it online or from a hardware store and bring it to your working area. The average stick welder will be anywhere from $75 - $400 USD.MIG welders typically cost anywhere from $100 - $1,000 USD.You can always look on online marketplaces for refurbished or used models that may be more affordable.\n","Welding materials\n","Commonly used materials for welding include steel and stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, cast iron, copper, brass, and magnesium alloy. Each type of metal will respond differently and may be better suited for certain welding styles. For instance, steel, stainless steel, and aluminum are ideal for MIG and Stick welding.[7]If you think it, you can make it. However, common welding items include fireplaces, coat hooks, wine bottle holders, bar stools, and storage racks.\n","Look for welding classes at community and art centers.\n","Search online or on your local community's or art centers website to see if there are any introductory welding classes available. These courses will already have a workshop and equipment set up for you, so you dont have to purchase it yourself, and will provide introductory instructions that can help you get started on your welding hobby.[8]These courses can range anywhere from a day of training to 2-3 months of training.Ask for a class schedule before you sign up for the classes.\n","Contact a community college to see if they offer welding classes.\n","Many community colleges, vocational schools, and some universities offer welding classes as part of their curriculum. If you are going to school or plan on going to school, search on the schools website to see if they offer welding classes. Then, sign up for the class during your class registration period.[9]You dont need to obtain a college degree to learn welding. Contact your local community college or vocational school to find out if they have non-credited welding classes you can sign up for.You can receive a welding certification through the American Welding Society, which may be required for a career in welding. This can be obtained through a trade or vocational college.[10]\n","Speak to local welders in your area if you cant sign up for a class.\n","If no community centers or schools offer welding classes, or you cant afford them, local welders may be willing to show you the ropes. Search for welding or metal fabrication companies near you, and then call them and tell them that youre interested in touring their workshop. Arrange a time and date to visit them, then express your interest while taking the tour. Welding and metal fabrication companies often offer free tours.If you want to learn how to weld, ask metal fabricators if you can apprentice or work as a fellow under them.Seeing welding in person will give you a better idea of whether its the hobby for you.\n","Watch video tutorials online to learn common welding techniques.\n","You can use YouTube to provide supplemental knowledge for the classes that youre taking or to learn different welding techniques. Because welding can be dangerous, practice under the supervision of an experienced welder before you start doing it yourself.[11]\n","Read articles and books on how to weld.\n","You can visit the American Welding Societys website to read articles and publications on welding. If you want to enhance your knowledge of different welding practices and techniques, try these popular books:[12]Welding: Principles and Applications by Larry JeffusAudel Welding Pocket Reference by James E. Brumbaugh and Rex MillerWelding Essentials by William L. Galvery Jr. and Frank B. Marlow\n","Work in a well-ventilated area and wear safety gear.\n","Inhaling the noxious fumes from certain welding machines is dangerous and unhealthy. Open windows and doors to make sure that the room is well-ventilated. In addition, make sure to wear all safety gear before you start welding.[13]To protect your eyes and face wear a welding helmet, hand shield, or goggles. Use fire-resistant ear muffs or plugs to prevent sparks from entering the ear.[14]Use a respirator to protect your lungs from fumes and oxides and fire or flame-resistant clothing and aprons.Opt for rubber-soled safety shoes and insulated gloves to protect against electric shock and heat.Welding supplies can be purchased online or through your local hardware store.\n","Use 100% Argon or a mixture of CO2 and Argon (ArCO2) gas.\n","Generally, a gas-shielded MIG welder is the standard machine that people use. Attach an ArCO2 gas tank by securing it to the side of the machine with a metal chain. Remove the tanks protective cover, and attach the gas regulator flow meter by hand, tightening with a wrench. Then, screw the gas hose to the regulator and the MIG machine. Open the gas valve half-way. Set the flow rate to 20 Cubic Feet per Hour (CFH) while pulling the MIGs trigger.[15]You do not need gas to MIG weld. However, youll need to use a specific flux-cored filler wire instead of a gas tank.[16]A shielding gas tank protects the weld pool (the dime-sized portion of a weld where the base has reached its melting point) from the atmosphere and similar outside contaminants.[17]\n","Select the appropriate amperage output and wire size.\n","When setting up your MIG welder, the material thickness youre working with determines the amperage you need. Generally, each .0001 inch of material thickness requires 1 amp of output. From there, you can select the appropriate wire size. Typically, when working between 30 and 130 amps, youll use a .023-inch wire.[18]Always consult your machines owners manual as it contains important information about operation and safety.When in doubt, you can consult online wire size charts to determine the amperage you need to work with.\n","Adjust the wire speed and voltage to make a consistent weld.\n","Your machine determines your speed, the type of wire, and the metal thickness youre welding. Generally, your machine will come with a chart, manual, or specification guide that you can refer to. However, it may be a game of trial and error. As you weld, listen for a consistent sizzle similar to the sound of bacon on a frying pan. Thats how youll know youre welding a proper bead. If you weld cracks and spurts, adjust your settings.[19]Typically, slower wire speeds work better on thinner pieces of metal.You can also consult online charts to determine the wire speed, which may require some math.For example, if youre working with 130 amps, multiply 3.5 x 130 = 455 ipm (inches per minute) for the wire speed.[20]\n","Attach the welder's ground clamp to your workstation.\n","Grounding the welder is essential, or you may electrocute yourself as you weld. The ground clamp should be attached to a flexible hose coming from your welder. Attach the clamp to the table or workstation that you plan on welding on.[21]\n","Position the tip of the gun at a 20-degree angle as you weld.\n","Always hold your welding gun with both hands. Position the tip of the gun towards the metal at a 20-degree angle so that you can push the weld away from you.[22]Pushing the trigger will feed the wire through the machine at a regulated rate and create the weld.If the welding machine isn't working properly, adjust the settings and try again.Remember to wear your welding gloves and safety goggles or a helmet so your skin isnt exposed to sparks or heat.\n","Move your gun in tiny circles as you weld to create a bead.\n","A bead is the proper weld shape and looks like tiny, overlapping circles. When you practice welding, make these tiny circles to create a bead instead of pushing the welding gun in a straight line.[23]\n","Practice welding on scrap metal before you work on a real project.\n","Practice running straight beads on pieces of scrap metal before trying to weld 2 pieces of material together for a bigger project. This will help you acclimate to the equipment, achieve straighter welds, and work out any kinks. [24]Beginner Friendly Projects Ideas: A metal box, welding table, MIG gun holder, or a horseshoe dutch oven holder.[25]\n","Attach the clamp and electrode holder to the machine.\n","Hook the clamp, also known as the work lead, to the negative terminal. Then attach the clamp side to your work table. Then, hook the electrode holder into the positive lead (DCEP, which means Electrode Positive). This makes it easier for first-time welders to create a uniform bead as they begin to weld.[26]If your machine has multiple functions for different welding types, like TIG, be sure to enter Stick mode.Stick welding doesnt require gas tanks.[27]\n","Set the amperage to the same level as your stick.\n","The stick that attaches to your welding gun is an electrode, often called the rod. Different rods will have specifications on their packing or instruction manuals, explaining the proper amperage your machine needs. Generally, youll want to use:[28]40-80 amps for a 3/31-inch 6010 or 6011 Rod.75-125 amps for a -inch 6010 or 6011 Rod.You can use an online stick welding calculator to plug in the material youre working with and the type of electrode to get a suggested amperage range.[29]\n","Tap your rod against metal to start it up.\n","Tighten the electrode in the welding gun before you start. Lightly strike the rod against the metal like a match to start the weld. When it successfully starts welding, you'll see an electric arc coming from the electrode on your gun.[30]Remember to wear a non-flammable apron, welding mask, and gloves before you weld.\n","Position your rod based on your work angle.\n","If youre working with a 90-degree joint angle, position your rod at a 45-degree work angle, coming in with a flat or overhead fillet joint.[31]For a 180-degree joint angle, use a 90-degree work angle to create a butt joint (where two pieces are joined together side by side).For a 90-degree lap joint angle (where two metals are overlapping), use a 60 to 70-degree work angle, using the road at a flat or horizontal angle.\n","Drag the rod to weld.\n","Unlike MIG welding where youre working in semi-circles, with stick welding you drag or pull your weld. Place your stick into the joint at an angle, then tilt your stick slightly sideways by 10 to 15 degrees. Pull the rod at a consistent speed to weld the material.[32]\n","How to Make a Drone (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Find a quadcopter design in a book or online for reference.\n","There are many websites and books devoted specifically to building your own drone. The most common kind of home-built drone tends to start with an X shape that allows you to mount 4 rotors (called a quadcopter). This design is easy to build and is used even on high-end drones. Having a design to follow will help make it easier to decide where best to place each component.Once you've finished a quadcopter drone, you can try larger designs that incorporate more motors to carry more equipment like cameras.Many drone designs are available for free online if you search DIY drone design.\n","Make a frame for the drone out of metal, plastic, or wood.\n","Begin constructing your frame using the material of your choice. Model plastic, balsa wood, or thin metal (thinner than .25 inches (0.64cm)) are best. For a simple quadcopter design, lay one 12in (30cm) long piece of wood, plastic or light metal across another, so it creates an X shape with 90-degree angles. Each extending arm of the drone frame should reach toward what would be the corner of a perfect square you could draw around the frame. Choose a frame material that is at least 1 inch (2.5cm) wide to support mounting your engines.[1]You can purchase model plastic, thin metal, or balsa wood at most hobby or model stores. You can also find these materials at drone retailers or on websites like Amazon.Use glue or duct tape to secure the two pieces of your frame together.Don't move on to the next step until the pieces of the frame are secure and any glue you've used has dried.\n","Purchase motors, propellers and other electronics from a drone retailer.\n","There are some components of your drone that can't be built from scratch, so you'll need to purchase them. If there is no drone retailer nearby, many hobby stores that carry model rockets and R/C airplanes will carry them.[2]You will need to purchase speed controllers, a power distribution board, and a flight controller along with the motors and propellers. Note that most modern flight controller comes integrated with power distribution board.If you have trouble finding the parts you need, many drone specific online retailers, as well as large retailers like Amazon, carry these parts.Drone engines should be rated to produce a total of twice as much thrust as the drone weighs. If your quadcopter will weigh 800 grams (28oz), each engine should produce 400 grams (14oz) so the combined total amount of thrust will equal 1,600 grams (56oz).Make sure the speed controller current rating is higher than that of your motor.You can often buy these components in bundles.\n","Drill holes in the frame to support the motors.\n","Most motors mount using anywhere from 2 to 4 screws. Place one motor at the end of one of the drone's extended arms and make marks where the holes need to be drilled. Then use those holes to guide you when using the drill. If you are using self-setting wood screws on a wood or plastic frame, drill the holes smaller than the diameter of the screws so they can work as a guide.If you are using metal, drill holes of the same diameter of the mounting bolts you'll use. You will then need to use nuts on the underside of the bolts to secure them in place.\n","Cut 4 .5in (1.3cm) rings from a 4in (10cm) PVC pipe to make landing gear.\n","Lay the pipe on its side and mark it where you'll make your cut. Then use a saw to cut all four sections, so you're left with 4 plastic rings made of PVC pipe. These four rings will serve as lightweight landing gear for your drone.The cuts don't have to be perfect as long as the rings are thick enough to be sturdy, but the better the finish on your cuts, the better the drone will look.\n","Stand the landing gear rings on their side and attach them with duct tape.\n","Place one ring on its side beneath each arm of the drone's frame, then use thin strips of duct tape to secure the rings to the arms. The drone will now stand on its own on your table. You can use glue instead of tape, but make sure it's completely dry before moving on.Keep the rings in the middle of the arms so they don't interfere with the placement of your motors or other components.\n","Mount the motors on the frame.\n","Place each motor over the holes you drilled for them and then use screws or bolts to secure them in place. Then slide the propellers over the posts extending from the top of the motors and screw the caps that came with the motors over the top of the posts.[3]The drone frame now has landing gear and motors, but the center portion of the frame should still be empty.Tighten the bolts or screws securely so the motors can't wiggle at all on the frame. Any slack will create vibrations that can make the drone unstable.\n","Use zip ties to secure the speed controllers to the bottom of the frame.\n","The electronic speed controllers that connect to the motors should be mounted on the underside of the drone frame to prevent it from getting too top heavy when you add the rest of the components. Zip ties are an easy way to attach them. Run the zip ties through the mounting loops on the speed controllers (or just across them) and over the frame. Then pull the zip ties tight so the controllers are firmly held in place.[4]Don't use glue the first time you assemble your drone, as you may find you want to adjust the positioning of different components based on how it flies.The speed controllers regulate how fast the motors on the drone spin. This ensures all four motors spin at the same speed so the drone will be level as it flies.\n","Secure the battery to the frame.\n","Consider the size and shape of your battery when looking for the right place to mount it. If it's flat, you can mount it in the center of the drone and then mount other components on top of it. If not, you may want to mount the battery on the underside of the drone along with the speed controllers.[5]In most applications, mounting the battery in the center of the top of the frame is the best place.Use zip ties to hold the battery in place so you can remove it and move it if you need to adjust the weight distribution of the drone later.\n","Install the power distribution board.\n","Center the power distribution board on the drone frame, on top of the battery if you placed it there as well. Connect the lines from the speed controllers and the battery to the board once you've zip tied it down.[6]The power distribution board relays the right amount of power to each component to keep the drone operating smoothly.\n","Attach the flight controller to the drone frame with zip ties and connect it.\n","The flight controller relays information from the remote control to the power distribution board. Position it on top of the power distribution board and then zip tie it down. Refer to the instructions for the flight controller and power distribution box to connect them properly, but in most applications, the connection will be one clearly marked wire that plugs directly from one into the other.\n","Buy a wireless remote control system that works with your flight controller.\n","Ask for help at your local hobby store or drone retailer to make sure to choose a remote control system that works with your specific flight controller. Often, you can buy them in bundles, but if not, the remote control system will list the flight controller systems it is compatible with on the box. Choose one that lists your flight controller.[7]The remote control system will come with the remote control itself that you'll use to pilot your drone.Check to see if your system takes off-the-shelf batteries or is rechargeable. You'll need to power it to connect it to your flight control system.\n","Connect the motors to the speed controllers.\n","Run the wires from the motors to their respective speed controllers on the underside of the drone's frame so power can be transferred into the motors once you power the drone up. While these connections may vary from brand to brand, they are usually a simple male/female connection that just needs to be pressed together.[8]If your components don't have a simple connector, refer to the instruction manual for the speed controller to assess the best way to connect them.You may need to solder the wire directly to a port on the motor itself. If so, check the manual for the motor as well, to ensure you're soldering the wire to the correct port.\n","Charge the drone battery.\n","Use the power supply that came with your battery to plug it into a wall outlet. Leave it plugged in until it reaches a maximum charge (usually four hours, but refer to the instructions that came with your battery to check for your specific application). You'll need the drone's flight controller powered to connect it to the remote control system.Many drone operators choose to purchase and charge multiple batteries, as each one will only power the drone in flight for a few minutes before needing to be recharged again.\n","Link the remote control system to the flight controller.\n","Follow the instructions that came with your remote control system to establish a link between the remote control and the flight controller mounted on the drone. On many applications, this connection is easy to establish: simply hold the sync button on both the remote control and the flight controller while they're near each other and the two will link up.\n","Fly your drone\n","in the air. Turn on both the drone (using the switch on the flight controller) and the radio control. Drone controls usually have at least two joysticks: the left stick controls the yaw (or the direction the drone is pointed) by moving left to right, and the throttle by going forward and backward. The right stick controls the roll (left to right) and the pitch (pointing the nose down or up).[9]Use the left stick to control speed and direction.Use the right stick to control the orientation of the drone (leaning left or right, angled up or down).\n","How to Exfoliate Your Scalp: Benefits, Products & More\n","Wash your hair with shampoo.\n","Exfoliating your scalp works best on freshly washed hair. So, hop in the shower or bath and give your head a nice scrub. Make sure all the suds are washed out before you get out.Some products work as a pre-shampoo treatment, so always check your exfoliants label before hopping in the shower.If youre using a DIY treatment, its most likely best to wash your hair first and exfoliate after.\n","Comb your hair to remove tangles.\n","While your hair is wet, use a wide tooth comb or wet brush to detangle any knots. This way, you wont have to worry about any tangles while you exfoliate.\n","Massage your scalp with product and rinse thoroughly.\n","Being too rough on your scalp or over-exfoliating can lead to hair loss and damage. So, to avoid this, start slow. Use gentle circular motions to massage your chosen exfoliating product (scalp scrub, serum, etc.) into your hair for about 5 minutes.[1]Place your scalp scrub or serum on your fingertips or massage it in with an exfoliating hair brush.Rinse the product out when youre done, and youre good to go.When in doubt, follow the products instructions on how to apply the specific product.\n","Exfoliate your hair once a week or month.\n","Depending on your hair type, you may need to exfoliate once a week or once every month. Start by exfoliating once every 2 weeks, then try once a week if you dont see results. If exfoliating every 2 weeks hurts your scalps, wait another 2 weeks before exfoliating again.[2]Avoid exfoliating your scalp before a chemical or color treatment, which could cause skin irritation.If you have eczema, consult your dermatologist before exfoliating to find the best schedule for you and your skin.\n","Consider applying a spray-on sunscreen before exfoliating.\n","If you have sensitive skin or a sensitive scalp, adding an extra layer of protection between your skin and the exfoliant may be wise. Add a few pumps of spray-on sunscreen to your scalp to help reduce sensitivity.While theres no evidence backing up this hack, many hairdressers and exfoliators swear by it.\n","Removes and prevents product buildup.\n","One of the main benefits of exfoliating your scalp regularly is that it easily removes any excess product on your scalp. Not only does this help your hair look and feel great, but it also prevents clogged hair follicles.[3]\n","Alleviates dandruff, eczema, and dry scalp.\n","Doctors will most likely recommend scalp exfoliation for dry skin conditions.

Pour the gas into the container first, followed by the water. Pour slowly to avoid splashing.[1]While working to separate the gasoline, make sure to use a container designed for storing gasoline, which should create a tight seal when closed. Also, don't fill the container more than 95% full, as the gasoline needs room to expand.If you try to hold the container while pouring, you can cause the vapors to ignite from static electricity.[2]If you want, you can add a few drops of food coloring to the water first to make it easier to see the layers of water/ethanol and gasoline when you're done.[3]\n","Shake the water and gasoline together.\n","Place the cap on the container, ensuring it's tightly sealed. Shake the mixture together thoroughly. You want to shake it for a good 15 to 30 seconds to make sure the water and gasoline are thoroughly incorporated.[4]Do not be anywhere near an open flame when performing this maneuver. Vapors can ignite.\n","Use a device like an Ethanator.\n","Once you shake the mixture, pour it into the Ethanator to sit. When the water has settled out, use the valve at the bottom of the bottle to drain off the water and the ethanol into a container.[5]When you're done, remove your gloves, and wash your hands thoroughly.You'll need to leave the mixture to settle for at least 3 to 4 hours, but you may want to leave it overnight or as long as 12 hours. Once the mixture is ready, it will be perfectly clear without cloudiness, and you'll see 2 distinct layers. The gasoline will settle on top and the water and ethanol mixture will settle on the bottom.[6]\n","Pour off the gas after the mixture settles, instead.\n","If you don't have an Ethanator, you can carefully pour the ethanol-free gasoline layer into another fuel-safe container, after it's been left to separate for several hours. Tip the container over another one to pour off the gasoline. This will be easier to do if you added the food coloring to the water, as you'll be able to see the layers better.This method probably won't be quite as easy or as safe as the Ethanator, as it's easier to spill gasoline this way. You may also waste a bit more fuel (by leaving it behind with the ethanol) than with the other method.\n","Pick a funnel that's twice as large as the liquid you'll add.\n","Separatory funnels are used in chemistry to separate liquids. It needs to be double the size so the liquid has room to move around.[7]\n","Check the valve at the bottom.\n","The valve, called the stopcock, should be in a closed position so liquid can't come out.[8] Use a ring stand to hold the funnel in the air, so you don't have to hold it.[9]\n","Pour the gasoline and water into the funnel.\n","Take the stopper off the top, and add the gasoline to the funnel. Pour the water in after the gasoline, and replace the stopper.[10]Use about 1 part water to 16 parts gasoline.Ensure there are no open flames around, as gasoline vapors can ignite.\n","Shake the solution.\n","Put your finger on top of the stopper. Turn the funnel upside down, and shake the solution. With the stopper facing downward, turn the stopcock to open to vent any pressure. Close the stopcock, and shake the solution some more. Repeat 2 or 3 times.[11]\n","Place the funnel back in the holder.\n","The stopcock should be facing downward in the ring stand. Let the mixture sit until the gasoline isn't cloudy anymore and you have a clear separation between the 2. It will take at least a couple of minutes.[12]\n","Drain the ethanol and water out of the bottom.\n","Place a container under the funnel. Open the stopcock to let the ethanol and water come out the bottom. Be careful to stop right where the mixture is separated, and close the stopcock.[13]\n","Pour the gasoline out of the top.\n","Take the stopper off, and tip the funnel upside down to pour the gasoline into a container approved for gasoline storage. Make sure to label both the gasoline and the ethanol clearly.[14]Do not fill the gasoline container more than 95% full so the gasoline has room to expand.[15]\n","How to Put a Collar on a Cat: 8 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Select a time to put the collar on.\n","The collar will be a new experience and sensation for your cat, so it will be important to choose a time of day when she will be a little less resistant to having the collar put on. You could try putting it on during her meal time or play time, when she will be distracted with another activity.[3] You could also choose a time when she is calm, such as when you are spending quiet time with her.\n","Let your cat investigate the collar.\n","Place the collar on the ground near your cat so that she can get used to it before you put it around her neck. To help her get more comfortable with the collar, you can put her own scent on it. To do this, you can rub the collar on your cat's bedding. You can also rub a soft cloth around your cat's mouth (if she will let you) and then rub this cloth on the collar. The collar may not seem so foreign and strange to her if she recognizes her own scent on it.You could also purchase a synthetic pheromone spray at your local pet store and spray this on your cat's collar.Do not rush your cat's investigation of the collar.\n","Put the collar on your cat.\n","When your cat is calm and content, slowly and gently place the collar around her neck. Talk to her in a soothing and reassuring voice while you are putting the collar on to make the experience as comfortable as possible for her. Give her a treat when you have the collar on so that she can begin to make a positive association with wearing it. Your cat will probably fidget with, or scratch at, the collar and try to get it off the first time that you put it on.[4]The first time that you put the collar on, leave it on for a few minutes then take it off.Put the collar on your cat each day, leaving it on for longer and longer each time. Your cat may need some time before she's more comfortable with wearing the collar all day.Consider giving her a treat each time that she has the collar on and doesn't try to get it off. Eventually, she will get used to the collar being on without needing a reward.If she manages to get the collar off on her own, put it back on but do not give her a treatshe may think that she is being rewarded for getting the collar off.\n","Check the fit of the collar.\n","It is very important to make sure that your cat's collar does not fit too tightly or loosely around her neck. You will know that the collar fits correctly if you can snugly yet comfortably slide two to three fingers between the collar and your cat's neck.[5] Your cat may tense her neck when she has the collar on for the first time, so you may need to wait a few minutes until she relaxes her neck muscles before testing the fit.[6]Do not put pull or tug on the collar when you are sliding fingers under it.If the collar does not fit correctly the first time, remove it from your cat and adjust it accordingly.\n","Check your cat's collar on a regular basis.\n","Your cat may lose or gain weight as she gets older.[7] If significant enough, her weight changes could cause her collar to become too loose or too tight. If you notice that her collar is hanging loosely around her neck or seems to be squeezing her neck, take it off and make the necessary readjustment.\n","Choose a safe collar.\n","When you walk into your local pet store, you will notice that there are many types of cat collars from which you can choose. Despite the many choices, keep in mind that safety is the most important feature of any cat collar.[8] Breakaway collars are considered to be the safest type of collar for cats, since they will automatically open up if your cat accidentally gets her collar stuck on something (e.g., window blinds, furniture).[9]Breakaway collars will typically have a fastener that will automatically unclasp with enough pressure.Some collars come with attachments, such as bells. Although these attachments can be useful for an outdoor cat (e.g., alerting potential prey to the cat's presence), they can also get caught or stuck on things, which could be dangerous for your cat.[10]\n","Examine the collar.\n","Before you purchase the collar, run your fingers along the entirety of the collar. It should not have any rough or sharp edges that could irritate your cat's skin. You should also check to see if the stitching has started to unravel. If the collar has a fastener, make sure that the fastener does not have any sharp edges when fastened.[11]Consider testing the strength of the fastener before leaving the store. Pull on the collar with varying amounts of pressure. The fastener should release with a moderate amount of pressure. If it releases with barely any pressure at all, then your cat could slip out of the collar too easily.The amount of pressure needed to release the fastener will depend on your cat's weight and size.[12] For example, a heavy cat would probably need a fastener that releases with more pressure than would be necessary for a light cat.\n","Avoid elastic collars.\n","Some cat collars will have a section of elastic fabric woven into them, which would stretch to the point where your cat could get out of the collar if it gets stuck on something.[13] However, elastic collars can serious injury to your cat if she happens to get her leg stuck through it.[14] Elastic collars also have the potential to get stuck over your cat's jaw, which can cause serious injury.If you choose an elastic collar and it gets stuck on your cat in a way that causes injury, take your cat to your veterinarian immediately for treatment.\n","How to Put Yourself First: 13 Easy Ways to Take Care of You\n","Its okay to say no sometimes.\n","If youre not careful, people will demand too much of you, leaving you burnt out.

Not every annoying comment needs to be dealt with. Also, it may not be in your best interest to try to confront a person.Is this an opinion worth spending your time disputing? Some opinions may be annoying but is pointless to argue. For instance, the science fiction community may likely never agree if Star Wars or Star Trek is the better franchise, and the die-hard factions are not likely to be swayed by any argument by the other side. In the end, it is a matter of personal opinion.Are you going to win this battle? Fighting the good fight is a laudable action. However, there are places and situations that your actions are not going to change anyone's mind and you will be impacted quite negatively (or worse, an innocent person) in the process. This also means your energy, time, and mood.Is this opinion hurting someone else? Calling out someone for a racist, sexist, bullying or otherwise harmful action or words is generally the right thing to do. Just having a different opinion may not be.\n","Confront the person in private, if possible.\n","People tend to become very defensive if corrected in public, which may make the situation worse. If appropriate and possible, take that person aside and have the conversation in private. Having the conversation in public will only cause embarrassment and hurt feelings. Maintain a respectful tone. Your tone and attitude will be important if you want to take the step of addressing the situation with the opinionated person. Make sure your tone isnt angry or sarcastic, and speak softly while maintaining a nonthreatening posture. If the other person gets angry, dont raise your voice or get similarly agitated.Remain calm and restrained in your interactions. The worst way to interact with an opinionated person is to be combative and domineering. This approach will invariably lead to a game of one-upmanship to prove who knows the most or who can dominate the other. No one wins in this situation.\n","Model ideal conversational strategies.\n","You cant hold someone else to a standard that is higher than the one you use for yourself. Thus, for the know-it-all, you should model that you dont know everything and that you recognize that admitting your shortcomings is not a sign of weakness.[1]Use I statements instead of you statements. Though youll feel as if the other person is causing the problem, you should resist the temptation to speak in an accusatory manner. Instead, frame your issue from your perspective.I have been interrupted by you several times now is better than saying You talk all the time and you dont respect me. [2]Listen as much as you talk. It is possible that the opinionated person will be angry or indignant that you are confronting him or her. If that happens, take a deep breath and make sure to listen and not talk over the other person. If you need to walk away before the conversation escalates, dont be afraid to do so.Practice active listening.[3] If the person is defensive and tries to explain his or her perspective, repeat what the person says to prove that youre hearing the words accurately.You could say something such as, I hear you saying that you dont want to offend me and that Im overreacting. But what you are saying is [sexist, racist, ignorant, hurtful], and I do not like it.\n","Show respect during the confrontation.\n","Even if the opinionated person is a buffoon who knows nothing about the topics he or she is spouting off about, you should always treat that person like a human being with sincere beliefs and feelings.Asking questions also signals respect. The opinionated person is less likely to dismiss your concern if it seems as though you are trying to understand their perspective.Examples of questions to ask during confrontation include: \"How can I better communicate with you?\" or \"What do you think we both can do to improve our working relationship?\"Arm yourself with facts. When confronting an opinionated person, it's important to demonstrate how their behavior is detrimental to others, including yourself. Share facts and figures about how workplace collaboration is diminished when one person runs the show, or, how friendships are broken when one person's voice isn't valued.\n","Bite your tongue and smile.\n","In some cases  such as when the opinionated person is in a position of authority over you  youll have little choice but to make the best of a bad situation.[4]Reframe your conversations away from topics that make you uncomfortable. If you dont want to talk about the topics that the opinionated person brings up, shift focus to topics that you are more comfortable discussing. It does not have to be something you are even interested in, just steer the conversation away from sensitive topics. Ask the person about his or her family or interests.\n","Have an exit strategy.\n","If you know youre going to have to spend time with an opinionated person, make plans for minimizing the time you spend together.[5]At work, this could mean avoiding areas where that person is or having a reply prepared so that you can excuse yourself and leave the situation. At family events, plan activities that will allow you to avoid face-to-face conversations.\n","Establish healthy boundaries.\n","If the opinionated person insists on talking about religion, politics, money, or any topic that makes you feel uncomfortable, attempt to privately tell that person that you dont like to talk about such things and that youd appreciate avoiding those discussions.[6]Be firm. If the person keeps bringing up those topics, remind him or her that you dont want to have that discussion. For example: \"I'm so glad you have gotten so much from your faith. But I feel my belief in God is a private thing, and I'd rather talk about something else.\"Say something such as I know you have strong opinions on that, but that topic makes me uncomfortable. I really dont want to talk about it.Or, simply deflect: \"Let's talk about something lighter, huh? Tell me, how is that new baby of yours?\"\n","Be tactful.\n","If the opinionated person is constantly giving advice or trying to show you a better way to do something, simply respond with a respectful Thanks for the suggestion or I appreciate you pointing that out to me. If he or she is correct, youll want to follow the advice. If not, simply ignore it and do whats best.Realize that you might find yourself reacting against the opinionated person. There might be times when the opinionated person really does know what he or she is talking about but is putting forth his or her opinions in an obnoxious or domineering way. In those cases, you might be tempted to ignore his or her advice, simply to make a point. Dont let anger cloud your judgment.Resist the temptation to be passive-aggressive. Even if you dont get into a shouting match with an opinionated person, you might be tempted to roll your eyes at them or mutter snide comments under your breath. Doing so will only increase the tension between you and the opinionated person.\n","Remember that having an opinion is OK.\n","Many individuals are taught to not really have or express an opinion at all. If this is so, it can feel really uncomfortable to be around someone who not only has a strong opinion, but willing to clearly articulate this fact. And especially so if he or she finds lively debate enjoyable, even seeking it out unsolicited. This can be for a number of reasons:Cultural differences: Some cultures downplay frank open discussion on sensitive matters, while others treat it as rude not to talk out things.Gender upbringing. Women more often than men tend to be taught to be quiet and demure, not outgoing and outspoken. A woman who is articulate and outspoken may be considered domineering, while a man doing the same thing is often evaluated much more positively.Family upbringing. In some families, children are encouraged to speak up on opinions, while others are taught children are seen and not heard. Birth order can make a difference, too.Personality differences. Some people are more outgoing and judgmental, while others are more concerned with getting along with others and keeping an open mind than on making hard and fast assessments. One personality type is not better than another. The personality type well suited to being a judge may not be the same as one best suited for being a minister.\n","Remember that everyone is entitled to his or her opinion.\n","Different people do not see eye-to-eye on the same things. And sometimes this can be difficult for some people to handle. It seems so wrong for another person to feel the way he or she does! But here are some things to remember:Having a different opinion does not mean he or she is less than you. The opinion is not the same as the person. One can have the same opinion as you, but that does not necessarily make the person better than someone with a different opinion.Listening does not mean agreeing. Simply listening to another person's point of view does not mean you agree with him or her. It just means you are hearing him or her out.You do not have to engage in every argument you are invited to. Some people live to argue, but this can get exhausting. And you will not win every time. And it is OK to simply give a pass to arguments, especially if you have little or nothing to gain or a lot to lose.\n","Realize opinionated people might have no insight into their behavior.\n","In most cases, an opinionated person isn't trying to be offensive and might wonder why people avoid him. If you offer empathy instead of judgement, you might be integral in helping him better understand his situation.[7]\n","Try to get to know the person at a deeper level.\n","If you already dont like the person, it will be difficult to want to get to know him or her better. Even so, try to see the person as a human being, with a family and friends and a life. The more you get to know them as a person, the easier it will be to show empathy.[8]\n","See the opinionated person as a potential resource.\n","Since the opinionated person has no shortage of opinions to offer, you might be able to use whatever knowledge he or she possesses to your advantage.For instance, the person might know something about office dynamics where you work and be open enough to give you information that no one else will. If the person is a family member, he or she might tell you stories that everyone is too polite to mention. You might be surprised what youll learn.\n","Find common ground.\n","Even if you find the person obnoxious, you almost certainly have areas of interest that overlap. If you dont want to talk about politics, maybe you share an interest in music. Or, if you dont want to talk about sports, maybe you can discuss adventures with family and parenting. Find those areas you have in common and focus on them.[9]\n","How to Braise Beef (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Select an inexpensive cut of meat to braise.\n","While it may seem contrary to usual meat-buying logic, tougher or less-tender cuts of meat are perfect for braising. Pot roast, chuck roast or any inexpensive cut may be used. The muscle fibers and connective tissue that make these cuts stringy or tough are broken down by braising, which gelatinizes the collagen into a more palatable texture. Low heat and long cooking times are used to make a tough cut of any kind of meat moist, tender, and delicious, when cooked properly. Common cuts of beef for braising include:top blade roasteye roastseven bone, or center-cut pot roastshankribs or short ribsbrisketIt's unlikely that you would ever want to braise any kind of lean steaks or loin. You could, but because these meats are tender already, it'd be a bit of a waste.\n","Select a braising liquid.\n","Other than a pot and your cut of beef, the only other absolutely essential ingredient is a liquid in which to simmer the meat. Because this is an opportunity to add a dash of flavor to the dish, it's most common to use wines, stocks, or other flavorful liquid, as opposed to water.[1] Common braising liquids include:Beef stock or broth. You can match the stock to the dish by using a beef-based broth or stock, although using chicken stock would is universal for braising any type of meat, and might add a nice complexity to your braised beef. Stock is just broth that hasn't been seasoned, so stock is generally better for braising, since it allows you to control the salt-levels, but either is acceptable. Just go easy on the salt if you use broth.[2]Red wine. Dry red wine can add a nice acidic note to beef, especially when combined with another braising liquid, like stock. The alcohol cooks off, resulting in a rich and fragrant dark sauce. Especially fruity or sweet red wines would be less desirable, but fine if paired with an equal amount of stock to cut the sweetness. The fruitiness of a white wine would pair better with chicken or pork. Since it'll season your dish, make sure it's something you'd like to drink--pour yourself a glass for \"research.\"Dark beer. English cooking at its finest. Stouts, porters, or black lagers all lend a rich sweetness to beef, and a malty depth of flavor.  The darker the better, when it comes to beef. Some Belgian ales might also work nicely, but experiment and find a beer you with a nice flavor. In general, lighter pilsners and lagers are more appropriate for chicken or pork.How much liquid you'll need will depend on the amount of meat you're braising, and the addition of extra vegetables. As a rule of thumb, you'll want enough liquid to cover the vegetables at the bottom of the pot and come up just to the level of the meat. You're not boiling the meat, or stewing it, so you won't submerge it in the braising liquid. It won't take much, and you can always add additional water to the pot if you didn't have enough wine left in the bottle.\n","Start with a mirepoix or some mix of finely minced vegetables.\n","Sounds fancy, but it's not. In French cuisine, braised beef and many other meat dishes will always start with a vegetable base of finely minced carrot, onion, and celery, called mirepoix, which is used to pair with the meat and enrich the sauce. After searing the meat, the mirepoix is added and browned briefly before adding the braising liquid to the pot.For a proper braising, there needs to be something at the bottom of the pot other than the liquid, to give the sauce fragrance, substance, and character, as well as to keep it from drying out. When minced very small, the mirepoix will mostly disintegrate into the liquid over the course of the long cooking time, to flavor the sauce, though you could leave larger chunks to do more of a \"pot roast\" style braised beef.Depending on the cut of meat, you might use around 2-3 carrots, 2-3 celery stalks, and a small white onion.\n","Choose additional vegetables to add as well.\n","Depending on what you want to do with the beef you braise, you might elect to make a one-pot meal with the addition of vegetables. In most braising, some variety of aromatic vegetable will always be used to keep the moisture consistent in the bottom of the pot, as well as to release other flavors and aromas. Cooking beef low and slow is a great opportunity to cook vegetables as well.Other vegetables like potatoes, cabbage, peas, mushrooms, greens, leeks, or other root vegetables can be added to the pot later, about 45 minutes before the meat is done cooking. Some fruits, like apple or pear, can also pair nicely with braised beef, depending on the season. Use firm, slightly under-ripe fruit, if you want to experiment.[3]Aromatic herbs like rosemary, sage, bay leaf, or thyme can kick your braised beef up several notches. If you've got access to an herb garden, or just want to buy some fresh herbs from the store, tie up a bundle of a few stalks in twine and add at the same time you add the braising liquid.\n","Always use a heavy-bottom stew pot or dutch oven.\n","Braising starts on the stove and moves into the oven, making it important that you start in a pot that's oven-safe. Enameled cast-iron pots are perfect for braising, featuring the heat-retention of cast iron and the hefty weight of a good baking dish.Skillets aren't generally big enough to hold all the braising liquid, meat, and vegetables required for a good braising, while thinner sauce-pans won't hold the heat as effectively as cast iron. If you don't have a cast iron dutch oven, though, anything you can cover and put in the oven will do in a pinch.If you don't have an oven-safe stew pot, but have a heavy-bottomed saucepan, it's perfectly fine to braise meat on the stove-top as well. Some cooks prefer the oven method because it more evenly-distributes heat throughout the meat, while others prefer the simplicity of braising on the stove. Both methods result in tender and delicious beef.\n","Prepare the meat for braising.\n","Season the meat on all sides with an even coating of salt and pepper. Go easy if you're going to braise the meat in broth, which will also be seasoned. If you want to add other spices to the dish, wait to add them until after the braising liquid has been added. Don't worry about trimming off fat or connective tissue, which will be broken down during the cooking process, providing great flavor.Some cooks like to dust the meat with a light coating of flour before browning it, while others choose not to. Flour can help to create a nice attractive crust on the meat during the browning, and it will work to thicken the sauce. Additionally, it helps to dry out the surface of the meat to promote browning. If you don't dust with flour, dry off the meat before you attempt to fry it. Damp beef won't brown.Depending on the cut of meat you're using, you may want to trim up the beef into manageable pieces, or leave it whole to braise the entire roast. Either method is perfectly fine, and will only majorly affect the presentation of the dish after it's done.In general, braised beef will be left whole, while \"stewed\" beef (which is submerged in liquid) will be cut into smaller chunks. The techniques are largely similar, so go with what you like best. If you'd like bite-sized chunks, go ahead and cut up your roast ahead of time. If you'd rather leave it whole and fork it apart later, that's fine too.\n","Brown the roast and then remove it from the pot.\n","Put your pot on the stove over a medium-high heat, coating the bottom with about two tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil starts to smoke, add your meat and let it brown on each side, until you've created a nice dark crust on the outside. Turn the meat periodically and be very careful not to scorch.You need to brown meat over high heat to cook the outside, not the inside. You'll cook the meat through in the liquid, so the browning is just used to create that tasty outer-layer of crust, as well as to season the bottom of the pot with drippings and little burned-on bits. The inside should still be very pink after you've browned it. Remove the meat from the pot and set it aside.\n","Add the mirepoix and saut over medium-high heat.\n","In the drippings and browned bits stuck at the bottom of the pan, add your finely-minced carrot, onion, and celery. Stir the vegetables around as they brown, taking care not to let them scorch.\n","Add about an inch of your braising liquid.\n","When your vegetable base is browned, add a small amount of braising liquid to deglaze the bottom of the pot. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up the stuff stuck to the bottom, which will help to flavor the sauce and the meat. Add enough liquid to cover the vegetables and bring it to a simmer.The difference between stewing and braising is the amount of liquid you add to the pot. Although they're very similar processes, technically-speaking, braised beef requires only the smallest amount of liquid, enough to cover the vegetables and create a humid environment in which to cook the meat. If you add a bit too much, don't worry, it'll be just as good.\n","Return the meat to the pot, cover it, and place in the oven at 325F (163C).\n","Once you've got the braising liquid up to a gentle simmer, add the beef back into the pot, settled gently on top of the vegetable/liquid mixture. Cover the pot securely and put it in the oven.If you want to braise on the stove, reduce the heat immediately to low and cover the pot securely. To keep things from drying out, it might be helpful to add a bit more liquid than you normally would, more like you would for a stewing, and to leave the cover on the pot as much as possible. Every time you remove it, the moisture will be released, causing it to get drier.As the meat cooks the liquid should condense and intensify, but the pot shouldn't dry out because you have the lid on. As it condenses on the top of the pot, it'll drip back down on top of the meat, basting it and keeping everything moist. Because you're creating a little cooking climate in the pot, you shouldn't remove it and mess with it. Let the pot and the heat do the work.[4]The braising liquid should not be boiling. If the lid of your pot is rattling because the bubbles are aggressive, turn the heat down some. Anywhere between 250 and 350 F is appropriate for braising. The lower the temp, the longer the cooking time.\n","Add additional vegetables 45 minutes to 1 hour before the meat is done.\n","To make sure everything finishes cooking at roughly the same time, you should add vegetables to the equation later in the cooking process, depending on what you want to add.Root vegetables like parsnips, turnips, carrots, potatoes, and beets can and probably should be added earlier in the cooking process. Add root vegetables to the pot when you return the meat, and cut into uniform bite-sized pieces.Delicate vegetables like greens, mushrooms, beans or peas should be added quite near the end, no more than an hour before you remove the braised beef from the oven. These may be added whole.Defrost any frozen vegetables you'd like to add before adding them to the braising pot. Adding frozen vegetables can bring down the temperature considerably, and they won't need to be cooked for very long anyway.\n","Remove the meat when fork-tender.\n","Depending on the size and variety of the cut you're braising, it should cook between 2 and 4 hours to reach its most tender state, and reach an internal temperature of around 160 F. When the beef is done, it should literally fall apart with very little pressure from a fork.As the meat cooks, moisture will be forced out, drying it out. When it reaches 160 F, it'll technically be \"done\" at this point, but it won't be as good as it can and should be for a proper braising. Since you've gone to all the trouble to braise it, really braise it. After a bit more time in the oven, the fibers will relax and reabsorb the gelatinized collagen, making the meat very tender.You shouldn't need to worry about under- or overcooking a braised beef dish. Cooking it longer only makes it better, and there's almost no risk of over-cooking it. If you're in doubt, cook it longer. It's not a dish to rush.\n","Remove the beef from the pot and let it rest.\n","When the beef is done cooking, remove it from the braising liquid, set it on a plate or a carving board, and cover it with foil to retain the heat. Braised beef should rest for at least 10 or 15 minutes before you carve it.You can carve braised beef however you wish to serve it, depending on the particular cut. Slices are appropriate for brisket, while short ribs will likely be left whole. Fork-pulling some roasts might be appropriate, as well, if you want more of a BBQ-style dish.If you've added additional vegetables, you can remove them as well, if you want to reduce the liquid to create a sauce or gravy. Spoon into a serving bowl, cover, and set aside.\n","Reduce the remaining liquid to create a sauce.\n","After you've removed the beef, put the pot back on the stovetop over medium-high heat to reduce the amount of liquid by half, or until it reaches the consistency you desire. Season the sauce to taste with salt, pepper, and a dash of Worcestershire.If you want to make gravy, you can also thicken the sauce by mixing a slurry of about a tablespoon of flour and a quarter-cup of sauce in a separate bowl. When the slurry is mixed thoroughly, with all the lumps whisked out, add it to your sauce slowly, whisking as you go. If you dusted the meat with flour before browning it, the sauce might thicken on its own by reduction. Cook it down some to check for the thickness before you worry about starting a slurry.Other additional aromatics like ginger, lemongrass, grated citrus rind, or garlic can be added to the liquid as it reduces for the sauce.\n","Pair with an appropriate side.\n","Most commonly, you'll see braised beef paired with the vegetables it was braised with, if you chose to include any, and a potato dish of some sort. Braised beef is excellent with the following side dishes:mashed potatoes or mashed sweet potatoeshash brownssweet parsnipsturnips or \"neeps\"greens like mustard, collard, turnip, or beet\n","Finish the dish with chopped herbs or other additions and garnishes.\n","A bit of chopped flat-leaf parsley, rosemary, or fresh herb of your choice can liven up the braised beef. Arrange on a platter, spooning over the reduced sauce or gravy you made from the leftover braising liquid.In many parts of the world, braised beef is a common Sunday supper, especially in the cold winter and autumn months. After slowly simmering the meat in the oven, the whole house smells rich and warm.\n","Marinade roast beforehand to braise sauerbraten.\n","A German variation on a basic braised beef, sauerbraten involves marinating a browned round roast in a mixture of vinegar and aromatic spices for up to three days before adding sugar and braising the beef in the marinade.[5]For the marinade, heat a cup of apple cider vinegar and red wine vinegar in a saucepan, with about two cups of water, over medium-high heat. To this, add one small chopped white onion and a half cup each of chopped carrot and celery. Toss in a teaspoon each of mustard seeds and whole clove, 2-3 bay leaves, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes while you brown the roast. After about 10 minutes, turn it off and let it cool to room temperature.Brown the roast in olive oil before removing and placing in a pot suitable for holding the meat and all the marinade. When the marinade has cooled slightly (you don't want it to cook the meat) pour it over the beef and let it sit in the refrigerator for about three days, turning it once a day to make sure the meat is equally submerged.After three days, braise in the oven at 325 F for about four hours after adding about a third of a cup of sugar to the marinading liquid. After braising, crushed-up gingersnaps and raisins are commonly whisked into the juice to thicken and add sweetness to the sauce, which is then poured over the sauerbraten.\n","Use sliced bottom round to make braised swiss steak.\n","While it has absolutely nothing to do with Switzerland, swiss steak involves the \"swishing\" process, by which one flattens fabric (in this case meat) with rollers or hammers. The tough meat is then braised in a rich sauce made from tomatoes, until fork-tender and delicious. Combined with mashed potatoes and fresh corn, there's nothing better than a properly cooked swiss steak.[6]To prepare the meat, cut round roast along the grain to form steaks roughly one half inch thick. Dredge each steak in flour, then pound out with a meat tenderizer until the steak flattens by half. Dredge the steaks again in flour and brown them on the skillet, over medium-heat in your dutch oven, or other oven-ready pot, on both sides. When the steaks turn golden brown on both sides, remove them from the pot and set aside.To create the sauce, fry a small white onion, chopped, two or three cloves of garlic, and two large celery stalks in your pot. Saut until the vegetables are browned slightly. To this, add a tablespoon of tomato paste and a can of diced tomato (or two medium fresh tomatoes, chopped), and about a cup of beef broth. Stir and bring to a simmer, adding some chopped oregano, Worcestershire sauce, and a tablespoon of lemon juice to the sauce.Return the meat to the pot and braise in the oven for about an hour and a half, covered, at 325 F. The meat should be done when it's fork-tender.\n","Make carbonade flamande.\n","Served with crusty bread, sweet-sour carbonade flamande is a deceptively simple Flemish flavor bomb, and a great way to mix up a traditional pot roast or braised chuck roast.[7]Start the process by cubing the beef into bite-sized chunks and browning them in the dutch oven. Remove them from the pot, then crisp up about 3 or 4 strips of chopped bacon, turning down the heat when the fat renders out into the skillet. To the pot, add a whole white onion, chopped, and slowly caramelize the onion adding about 2 tablespoons (30ml) of butter to the mix.Deglaze the pan with a bottle of Belgian ale, adding a cup of beef stock, and two tablespoons each of brown sugar and apple cider vinegar. Season the braising liquid with chopped tarragon, parsley, thyme, or whatever green herbs you prefer, and salt and paper to taste.Return the meat to the pot, then cook on the stove over low heat, covered, for about two hours, until he beef is fork-tender. Some recipes call for the braised meat to be topped with slices of bread for the last bit of the cooking time, which is broken down and stirred into the sauce to thicken. Often, this dish is served beside Belgian fries, or french fries.[8]\n","Make the ultimate comfort food with beef bourguignon.\n","The technique is easy and the flavor is classic French haute cuisine. It doesn't need to be complicated to be good.[9]Brown cubed roast in bacon grease, then remove it and saut the mirepoix. Stir in a tablespoon of tomato paste and add about 20 white pearl onions and a pound of white button mushrooms. Add salt and pepper to taste, while gently stirring the mushrooms and onions to coat. Deglaze the skillet with 2 or 3 cups of dry red wine, preferably Burgundy, and a cup of beef or chicken stock. Season with two bay leaves, and whole leaves of sage, rosemary, and oregano.Return the meat to the pot and braise at 325 F for about 3 or 4 hours until the meat is fork-tender. If the sauce is a little thin, remove the meat and cook it over medium-high heat on the skillet to reduce and thicken. Serve with roast potatoes.\n","How to Let Go of Clothes: 11 Tips to Declutter Your Closet\n","Picturing your style helps you realize what you dont need in your closet.\n","Before you start deciding what clothes to get rid of, develop the sense of style you want to have.

It may be easier to have some help making the decision.\n","Its a good time to let go if the styles have gone out of fashion.\n","If youre holding onto a lot of trendy items from the past, they may be taking up some valuable closet space you can use for more versatile clothes. Rather than keeping the items that you only wore a few times when they were in style, move on so you can update your wardrobe.Keep staple clothes that are versatile, like plain T-shirts, jeans, sweaters, trousers, button-down shirts, blazers, and little black dresses in your closet.\n","You probably dont need multiple options of the same style.\n","Its okay to keep a few options for things you wear regularly, like plain t-shirts or tank tops, but try to cut back on the number of items you have in styles you put on less frequently. If you notice you have a few options in the same style that are nearly identical, pick the one thats your favorite to keep in your closet and let go of the rest.[3]\n","Putting some clothes out of sight helps you check if youd really miss them.\n","If you dont want to completely get rid of some clothes, set them in a storage tote or box. Tuck the box in the back of your closet or under your bed so you dont see it. If you dont think about the garments after a month or two, youre safe to get rid of them.[4]If you kept thinking about the clothes in your maybe box, then that means theyre important to you and you should hold onto them for now.\n","Moving on from damaged items helps you declutter your closet.\n","If your favorite piece of clothing has a hole or tear, you may keep it for sentimental reasons and keep it in your closet. Even if you love that piece of clothing, its time to let go if theres so much damage that its stopping you from wearing it.[5]You can try to fix your clothes, but try to do it within a few days. If you leave the clothes for 2 weeks without fixing them, its a sign that you can get rid of them.\n","Someone else may love your old clothes if theyre in good condition.\n","If you have a friend who would be interested, offer to give them the garments you dont wear anymore. If you want to give back to the community, try  donating clothes to a charity near you. For higher-end items, try selling your clothes to make some extra money.\n","Reusing old clothes lets you keep them without taking up closet space.\n","Rather than completely getting rid of those clothes that you love, look for a way to reuse the garments around your home. You could transform your favorite clothes into keepsakes, such as turning shirts into a blanket or making a shirt pillow.[6]If you want to reuse a wedding dress, cut the material to put in a scrapbook or locket.\n","You dont need to hold onto clothes just because they were expensive.\n","If you bought a piece of clothing, you might want to keep it because you spent your own money on it. But if the garment just stays in your closet, youre not using or moving on from it. Think of if there are any other reasons why you need to keep the garment around, but if you cant think of any, then its probably time to let it go.[7]Rather than holding onto clothes because they were expensive, appreciate and cherish the memories from the times you wore them.\n","4 Ways to Make Cake in a Mug - wikiHow\n","Grease the inside of a large, microwave-safe mug.\n","Choose a large mug that is about 12 to 16 ounces (350 to 475 mL).

Search online or look through wildlife books to find out the birds natural diet, or ask your veterinarian if youre still not sure.[1]For instance, cardinals eat seeds, songbirds need a combination of insects and plant foods, and gulls or terns need crickets and small minnows.If youre not sure what type of bird you have, consult a field guide or contact a wildlife rehabilitator.[2]In many cases, you can feed the baby bird softened dog or cat food, as long as it contains 30-40% protein.\n","Keep the baby bird well-fed with formula or mash as you transition.\n","While it might seem like holding back formula will encourage the baby bird to start trying solid food, this can actually make weaning harder. When baby birds are hungry, they seek comfort and food from their mother. If the baby is well-fed, however, it will feel more confident and secure, and will be more likely to try out some of the new foods that you introduce.[3]Try offering a little solid food right after a formula feeding to encourage the baby bird to try it.\n","Add more solids to the birds mash as its feathers come in.\n","In most cases, if a baby bird is featherless or still very fuzzy, it probably needs to be hand-fed, since its mother would likely still feed it in the wild. However, once its flight feathers start coming in, thicken its formula or mash a little so the baby bird can get used to tasting and processing slightly more solid food.For instance, if youre making mash out of dog or cat food thats been soaked in water, you might add in 1-2 pieces of food that havent been soaked quite as long, so they retain a little of their texture. You can also buy commercial weaning pellets from a pet supply store. These pellets are nutritionally designed for baby birds.[4]This mimics how birds eat in the wild. As baby birds get older and start to eat more, the parents dont have time to digest the food as much before giving it to the baby bird. The baby then gradually transitions to eating solid food.\n","Place a little solid food in a heavy food dish when the bird starts to peck.\n","Although the timeline will vary depending on the species, baby birds will typically start to peck long before theyre ready to start weaning. Once you see the bird pecking at its feet and the bottom of its cage, offer it a little solid food, such as millet, suet cakes, rolled oats, or tiny pieces of insects, depending on what the species eats in the wild.[5]If you use a lightweight dish, the bird might tip it over, creating a big mess. Try using a heavy plastic lid or a dish made specifically for feeding birds.If youre feeding the bird live mealworms, crush the insects heads with tweezers before you place them in the dish.\n","Use tweezers to peck at the food if the baby bird needs encouragement.\n","In the wild, a baby bird learns to eat solid food by watching the adults around it. If the bird doesnt seem to know what to do with the food in its dish, take a pair of tweezers and tap at the dish. You can also pick up a piece of food with the tweezers and offer it to the baby bird the way its mother might.[6]To avoid startling the baby bird, only tap about once every second or so.\n","Clean the baby birds face after it eats solid food.\n","Baby birds can get food in their nostrils or eyes while theyre eating, which can lead to pain and discomfort or even infections. To avoid this, gently wipe the baby birds face with a cotton ball or a cotton swab each time you feed it.[7]This mimics the type of grooming a mother bird might do.\n","Weigh the baby bird on a gram scale daily and record its weight.\n","When youre ready to start transitioning to solid food, its important to make sure the baby bird doesnt lose too much weight. Weigh it every morning before you feed it and write down its weight. If you notice that its weight starts to drop, offer it a little more formula throughout the day.[8]Losing around 15-20% of the birds total body weight is normal, especially as the bird reaches its adult weight. However, if you notice any quick drops, there might be cause for concern. Add more formula to its diet and consult a vet if the bird starts to refuse food or act sick.\n","Check the birds health daily as well.\n","Each day, as you weigh the bird, make sure that it looks healthy and alert. Its eyes should be shiny and bright, its mouth should be clean, and its feet should be plump. In addition, listen to the birds breathing. You shouldnt hear any wheezing, clicking, or whistling.If you notice any changes in the birds health, contact a vet or a wildlife rehabilitator.\n","Keep solid foods in the cage regularly once the bird has all of its feathers.\n","Although you should start introducing solid food early, by the time the baby bird has all of its feathers, its ready to start the weaning process in earnest. Provide a wide array of species-appropriate foods for the baby bird, with a variety of textures, flavors, and shapes.[9]For instance, you might offer the bird different fruits, vegetables, and seeds, if that fits with its diet.If youre weaning a tern or a gull, place a shallow dish filled with live minnows in its enclosure.\n","Skip the morning or mid-day feeding for one day to start.\n","When you see the bird exploring its adult food, wait until the next day, then skip one of its early feedings and offer it solid food instead. The next day, give it all of its formula feedings, along with the solid food. Alternate doing this for a few daysskipping a feeding one day and giving it all of its formula feedings the next day.\n","Monitor the baby birds poop for changes in the consistency.\n","As you start introducing solid foods, keep an eye on the baby birds poop. The exact appearance will depend on the species, but it should remain relatively unchanged as you start offering solid food. If you notice any major changes in texture or color, wait a few days before making any more changes to the birds diet.If the poop appears thin or watery, the bird might be getting too much liquid in its diet. Try reducing the amount of water in its formula.\n","Reduce the amount of formula youre giving in the early feedings.\n","Once the bird starts getting used to the solid food, gradually reduce the amount of formula or mash youre giving it during its morning and mid-day feedings. However, dont eliminate them completely until youre sure the baby bird is getting all the food it needs from its adult diet.Try giving the baby bird about 3/4 as much formula as you normally would, for instance. After a few days, give it 3/4 of that amount, and so on.\n","Add a water dish to the cage when you eliminate a formula feeding.\n","While the bird is being formula fed, it doesnt need to have access to water, since it gets most of its water intake from its food. Once youre ready to start cutting out one of its formula feedings, though, the bird will need to have water available to make up the difference.[10]Baby birds can easily drown in a water dish, so its best not to include one in the cage until its older.If the water in your dish is deeper than about 1in (2.5cm), place smooth rocks in the dish as a perch.\n","Drop to 1 night-time feeding, then none, as the bird starts to reject the formula.\n","Typically, birds will start to prefer solid food and will show less interest in formula. The baby bird may refuse the formula altogether, it might only eat a little, or it might regurgitate the formula shortly after you feed it. As this starts to occur, eliminate the daytime feedings, only offering the bird formula at the end of the day. Stop hand-feeding the bird entirely when it no longer wants any formula.[11]Continue monitoring the baby birds weight. You may need to add back in an occasional supplemental formula as the birds system adjusts to eating all supplemental food.\n","11 Ways to Not Let Your Life Revolve Around Your Boyfriend\n","Do the things you loved doing before you started dating.\n","Whether it be basketball, playing guitar, or running, dedicate some time each week to your hobbies and passions. This can help you remember who you are separate from your relationship. As you practice and get better, your confidence will likely increase as well.[1]If you enjoy biking, try some bike trails in your area or join a cycling club.Perhaps you like to play the drums. Practice each week and consider starting a band!It's okay to share interests with your boyfriend, but remember to focus on the ones you don't have in common, too. It's healthy for you and your boyfriend to have separate interests.\n","It's important not to lose your ambition when you start dating someone.\n","Before you started dating your boyfriend, you likely had certain career goals or projects you wanted to start. Make sure you're still working towards those dreams, and try your best not to let your relationship distract you from reaching them. You'll feel better about yourself if you go for what you want in life, and it'll help you remain independent despite being in a committed relationship.[2]Keep working towards that promotion at work. If you're not super satisfied with your career, consider taking classes or switching career paths. It's never too late to follow your dreams.Try your best not to make yourself small or pass up on opportunities for your boyfriend's sake. If he's a healthy, supportive partner, he will be happy for you.\n","It's impossible to get everything you need from just one person.\n","To avoid relying too heavily on your boyfriend, spend plenty of time with your friends and family. Be a supportive friend and family member by making plans with them often and being there for them. Your life will feel more full, and it'll help you feel more secure with your boyfriend (he won't be your whole life, just part of your life).[3]Grab lunch with your friends, visit your family if they live in the area, and call up friends and family that live out of town.Avoid rescheduling or canceling your plans to accommodate your boyfriend. If he asks you to hang out while you're out with a friend, tell him that you're busy and give him an alternate time.\n","You don't need another person to feel whole.\n","Try going on a solo adventure at least once a week. This can help you learn new things about yourself and feel more at peace on your own. That way, you can avoid feeling overly attached to your boyfriend or afraid to leave his side. Try going to a movie at a local theater by yourself. Order some popcorn and a soda and make an evening out of it.Spend the day reading at a local park or coffee shop.\n","Being honest helps you retain your independence.\n","If you stifle how you're feeling, you run the risk of compromising your values and losing yourself in the relationship. Next time you have a concern, tell your boyfriend respectfully and directly. Conversations like this help you and your boyfriend remember your identities within your relationship.[4]\"I totally understand that you like keeping our apartment a certain way, but I'd love to add my decorations to the space, too.\"\"I love hanging out with you every day, but I think I need to spend the day to myself.\"\n","Your boyfriend needs time to be alone and see his friends and family.\n","It might be tough to be away from him at first, but it's necessary for a healthy relationship. Encourage him to get some alone time or hang out with his friends and family. When he's out, try your best not to check up on him. He'll appreciate that you respect his space and will enjoy catching up with you when you meet up again.[5]When your boyfriend is out, make your own plans instead of waiting by the phone. It'll be easier to be away from him if you've got something to do as well.Keep your texting to a minimum when he's out with his friends and family. Sending him more than 1-2 texts might make him feel like you don't trust him or respect his space.\n","Try your best not to see other people in your boyfriend's life as a threat.\n","If your boyfriend is your whole world, it might be stressful or nerve-racking to see him spend time with other people. Anytime those thoughts start to creep up, remind yourself that it's a positive thing that other people love and support your boyfriend.[6]Next time you're feeling jealous, write down your thoughts in a journal or call up a friend. This can help you process your feelings and gain some perspective. You might find that you actually have no reason to feel this way!If your boyfriend is doing something that makes you uncomfortable, address the situation honestly and respectfully. Sometimes, jealousy means that your boyfriend crossed a boundary, and it's necessary to speak up.You might say, \"I understand that you and Sandra are good friends, but it makes me a little uncomfortable that you've been texting so much at night.\"\n","Texting your boyfriend nonstop might be messing with your head.\n","If you love your boyfriend, it makes sense that you'd want to talk to him all of the time. This can make it hard to focus on your other passions, responsibilities, and relationships, though. Find some balance by putting your phone away for a few hours each day. That way, you can give yourself fully to other aspects of your life. You'll also have more to talk about next time you catch up with him.[7]Resist the urge to respond to your boyfriend immediately 100% of the time. It's okay to wait a few hours to respond if you're busy.If it's taking your boyfriend longer to respond than usual, don't fret. He may just be busy! Put your phone away and do something else for a healthy distraction.\n","Building a life separate from your relationship takes work.\n","Relationships can be a little overwhelming, and even the most independent people struggle with feeling dependent on their partner sometimes. Practice self-compassion and make sure you're taking good care of yourself. Don't be afraid to treat yourself every now and then, too. Being kind to yourself can help you learn how to be your own best friend.[8]Get plenty of rest each night, eat a healthy and well-balanced diet, and exercise regularly.If you catch yourself feeling a little clingy, try not to beat yourself up over it. Acknowledge how you feel, forgive yourself, and make positive changes going forward.\n","Try to love who you are outside of your relationship.\n","Developing your confidence is a lifelong journey that can help you become more self-assured and comfortable on your own. By having faith in your unique capabilities and talents, you'll feel more secure with who you are (within your relationship and outside of it) and less likely to compare yourself to other people.[9] Here are some ways you can develop your confidence:Write down a list of qualities that you like about yourself and read over that list anytime you're feeling downReplace negative thoughts about yourself with something positive. If you catch yourself thinking something like \"I never do anything right,\" replace that thought with, \"I'm trying my best.\"Repeat a mantra like \"I'm beautiful, smart, and fun to be around\" or \"I love myself.\"Maintain confident body language by keeping your shoulders back and your head held high.Remember that confidence is a journey. When you slip up, forgive yourself and keep trying.\n","There's no shame in seeking outside help.\n","If you feel like you're too dependent on your boyfriend, it might be the result of a relationship dynamic you learned in childhood. Trauma in your past can also cause you to struggle with this. A therapist can help you get to the root of why you may be feeling this way and give you some coping strategies to move forward. If you'd like to work with a counselor or a therapist, get a referral from your doctor or search for one online.[10]If you grew up with a distant parent, for example, you may struggle to feel secure in your relationships as an adult.Having a history of traumatic or abusive relationships might make you feel more vulnerable in romantic relationships as well.\n","How to Write Best Selling Children's Books (with Pictures)\n","Pick an age range.\n","You do not want to walk up to an agent or publisher with a vague idea of your target audience. Agents and editors don't take well to book's that are \"for all ages.\" If you want to write a bestseller, it's important to have a niche age range in mind.[1]Things like picture books and stories with only a few words are usually for ages 2 to 6.Middle graders are generally ages 8 to 11. These would be stories targeted at mid-elementary school and early middle school.If you want to write for very young children, you can consider doing a picture book or a baby book.\n","Select a genre.\n","You do not want to go into the market without a clear genre. Many popular children's books are fantasy-based in nature, or feature talking animals. If you want to write a bestseller, fantasy may be a good idea. However, some famous children's books, like Kevin Henkes's Lily's Purple Plastic Purse, feature an animal character that faces a realistic setting. It can be nice to write a children's book with a story children can relate to.[2]Pick a genre that interests you. You're unlikely to stick with a project if you do not enjoy the genre. You're vastly more likely to produce an interesting product people will want to buy if you're passionate about your work.If you're a lifelong animal lover, for example, think about writing an animal book for children. Include animals as the main characters.\n","Figure out what makes your book unique.\n","There is a lot of competition in the world of children's books. If you're going to survive and become a bestselling author, figure out what makes your story unique. What unique experience can you bring to the table? What's a story that only you can tell?[3]Look at what's already out there. Familiarize yourself with the more popular children's stories so you don't produce a replica of an already established work. Try to see where there's room for diversity. Look at what the market is lacking.Think about your own life, experience, and passions. Maybe there's something unique about you that could help your work stand out. For example, there are lots of children's stories about animals, but how many stories feature a sugar glider? Maybe you own a sugar glider, and could tell a unique story from your pet's perspective.\n","Read as a writer.\n","Reading as much as you can is a vital part of the prewriting process. Surround yourself with the most popular and prominent works in children's literature. Look into your target age range. Stop by a local library and ask a librarian for recommendations in that range. Pay attention to how the stories begin. Does the work begin with action, dialogue, a scene? How does the author get you interested in the story? What makes the characters compelling right away? Focus on characters. In a children's book, characters may be somewhat simple in nature.Focus on language. Children's books are often written in very simple prose. They may also make use of things like rhyme, as they're often meant to be read out loud.Watch how the story ends. What resolutions are made? How have the characters changed? Is there room left for a sequel, or are all ends tied up?\n","Provide a likable main character.\n","Children need to be able to become invested in the main character in your book. As you write your children's book, focus on creating a main character with a lot of attitude. A fun, charismatic main character will get children invested quickly.[4]Look at Kevin Henkes's Lily in Lily's Purple Plastic Purse. Lily is cute, charismatic, and excitable. She is a character children can get behind.Give your character flaws, however. Every story needs a conflict. Lily, for example, is overeager and somewhat temperamental. This is what causes her disagreement with her teacher. Figure out one or two flaws your character can have that will ultimately drive the story's conflict.\n","Choose a setting that makes the ordinary dangerous.\n","One of the things that makes bestsellers compelling is they present a relatable experience, but find a way to make it extraordinary. Oftentimes, otherwise ordinary settings, like a boarding school or a small town, turn out to be dangerous. Children feel they are being let into the adult world when innocence is removed from a typical setting.[5]Think about Roald Dahl. Much of his stories take place in an ordinary setting that suddenly becomes frightening. In Matilda, for example, a conventional boarding school turns out to be a terrible place for the students. If you're doing a longer children's book, one that's the length of a chapter book, you could think of a similarly unexpected setting.Think about a setting children are familiar with. For example, you could write about a school. A young child could discover his school is haunted, for example. This takes a setting children are familiar with and adds something a bit scary to it.\n","Find a conflict.\n","Children face challenges in their day-to-day lives. They must overcome fears, confront challenges, deal with conflicts with friends and parents, and so on. Children want to read a book that reflects the conflicts they face. Think about a conflict you could introduce that your character must overcome.Look at something like the Berenstain Bears series. Most of the books center around a conflict related to young children. In \"The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with Junk food,\" for example, the children learn about healthy eating after a stressful doctor's appointment. The conflict is usually fairly easy to overcome, and helps teach kids a lesson.Think about a conflict that will get a child emotionally invested in a story. If you know any children, think about the kinds of conflicts they have. For example, maybe your niece Rosa struggled to fit in during Girl Scout meetings. Her friend Harper helped her overcome her shyness by sticking by her side during meetings. You could easily write a fun and relatable children's book based on this experience, focusing on themes like friendship and community.\n","Choose a  message.\n","Most children's books teach something to children. Sometimes, that message is practical. Children's books sometimes teach things like proper manners, or vocabulary. However, the message can also be more abstract. Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, for example, teaches about appreciating people over products. An inspiring message like this can really help your story resonate with kids.Think about what children need to learn. What did you have to learn as a child? Think about a memorable moment that taught you a lesson. Maybe, after your grandmother entered hospice care, you realized you never valued her enough. Through this, you learned to gain wisdom from past generations.You can work this lesson into a story. Talk about a young child who learns to value the stories his grandmother told him more, teaching him the importance of history and family.\n","Form a writing schedule.\n","If you want to write a children's book, work on getting organized. You should form a writing schedule for yourself. Work writing into your weekly routine, like exercising, doing your dishes, and brushing your teeth.Clear out a space to write in your home. Clear off a corner of a desk, or pick a spot in your bedroom. You can also write at a local coffee shop. It's important you pick a space free of outside distractions so you can focus on your work.Schedule time for writing. Think about when you feel most energetic. Some people feel invigorated in the mornings, while others feel enthusiastic later at night. Write during the time of day you feel most energetic.Set goals each day. You can have a specific word count, such as 100 words per day, or you can write a set number of pages each day. If you do not have time to write each day, set weekly goals. For example, you can promise you'll have 5 pages by the end of any given week.\n","Use appropriate language.\n","Children have a limited vocabulary, so you do not want to use too many big words. You should also minimize excessive language. Stick to simple sentences that convey the basics. Things like rhyming and rhythm can also help. Think of the works of Dr. Seuss. He makes excellent use of rhyme to make his stories compelling to a young audience.You can use some big words in a story. In fact, children may benefit from learning new words in a book. If you choose to use large words, find a way to explain them. Weave high-brow vocabulary words into your story in a smooth fashion.[6]For example, maybe you can have a character who works very hard at school and is a bit of a show off. He or she could use big words on occasion, and make a point of explaining these words to others.\n","Team up with an illustrator.\n","Almost all children's books are illustrated. If you're not artistically inclined yourself, team up with an illustrator. The two of you can create compelling images for your story that will make the book aesthetically pleasing.[7]Go to your friends who draw and ask them for advice here. Ask them if they would be willing to work with you. You can also post an ad online, on a site like CraigsList, seeking out illustrators for your book.Due to modern technology, you are not limited by location. You can find illustrators across the country. You can browse websites where people share their art. If you find an artist you like, reach out to him or her.Keep in mind a lot of artists will expect payment for their work. Budget for this.\n","Revise your story extensively.\n","Much of writing takes place during revision. After finishing a draft of your story, do many, many revisions. Most successful books were revised multiple times before publication.It's a good idea to have a print copy of your manuscript to revise. That way, you can make notes as you go. Ask yourself if the story moves quickly enough, if the plot is relatable to children, and if the conflict is solved in a rational manner.Evaluate your writing. Does the dialogue feel natural? Are the characters, settings, and scenes described in a compelling manner?In addition to major overhauls, watch for easy fixes like grammar issues. When you start sending your manuscript to publishers, it should be free of obvious grammatical errors.\n","Avoid peachiness or simple lessons.\n","Children's stories should not be simplistic in nature. Many people think you have to teach a lesson in your story. However, children are complex. Avoid simple lessons. Instead, explore a variety of complex themes. Many children's books explore wide-reaching themes like bravery, war, conflict, and parent/child relationships without explicitly providing their readers with a lesson about such subjects. It's okay to leave ambiguity in your work.[8]\n","Create a website or blog.\n","You're more likely to land an agent if you build a relationship with fans ahead of time. You can start a website or a blog about your book, and offer promotional materials like sneak previews, character profiles, and more. A lot of modern authors get their start online.[9]You can use free sites like WordPress to create a blog. Work on updating your blog regularly and try to post content that people will share. Readers often respond to easy-to-read content, such as lists.Create a social media presence as well. Link your blog to your Twitter, a Facebook fan page, and your Tumblr.You can try starting a YouTube channel, making short videos where you discuss writing, your book, and children's literature in general.\n","Network to meet the right people.\n","Networking is one of the main ways people get into publishing. If you get a short piece published in a journal, stay in touch with the editor. If you have an MFA in fiction writing, talk to your professors and colleagues. Attend reasonably priced writing conferences and try to meet agents and publishers.\n","Work with an agent.\n","It is very hard to get a children's book published without an agent. Many big publishing houses do not look at unsolicited submissions. You will need an agent if you want to write bestsellers.[10][11]You can find agents online through sites like Writers Market, Agent Query, and Query Tracker.Write a query letter to potential agents. This should briefly overview your publication history, online presence, and include a brief biography. You should also provide a synopsis of your book. Include a few sample chapters in the envelope you send to the agent.Follow all submissions guidelines carefully. Make sure you send in your chapters in the manner the agent prefers, following all the guidelines for formatting your manuscript exactly as requested.\n","Be prepared for rejection along the way.\n","The process to becoming an author, especially a bestselling author, is long and difficult. You will get a lot of rejections from agents and publishing houses along the way, so learn to cope with rejection.[12]Send out work frequently, and to a lot of different places. You're less likely to be stung by a rejection if you have a lot going on. A rejection from one agent will hurt less if you've already submitted to five.Also, keep in mind rejection is rarely personal. Most authors get rejected a lot, especially early on. Your work may not have been the right fit, it may have been too similar to another title, or the agent simply may not have had time to read it closely. A rejection does not mean you are a bad writer.\n","3 Ways to Cure a Yeast Infection in Your Lungs - wikiHow\n","Take anti-yeast probiotics to kill the yeast colony.\n","Anti-yeast probiotics are medicines that are designed to kill yeast colonies in your body. Set up an appointment with your doctor to determine which medication and dosage would work best for your specific situation.[2]Armoured Acidophilus is one of these medications that acts on the lining of the lungs.\n","Talk to your doctor about taking anti-fungal medication.\n","Another treatment option is to take an anti-fungal medication that will help to prevent an infection, such as if you are immunocompromised, or treat an infection.

While you can take medications (see Method 2) to clear up the infection, you must alter your diet if you hope to keep the infection from developing again.\n","Cut out or reduce the amount of sugars and artificial sweeteners you eat during the initial stages of your treatment.\n","Fructose, which is found in most fruits and honey, and artificial sweeteners like Saccharin and nutrasweet, should be cut out of your diet while you work on getting better. This is because these sweets can create a good growing environment for yeast, which combats the work you are doing to try to get rid of the yeast.[5]Avoid consuming fruit during the first two weeks of your fight against yeast. Other foods like beets and potatoes, which are also high in sugar, should also be avoided.\n","Read labels on packaged food to avoid certain sweeteners and other ingredients.\n","Packaged food that contains the following items should be avoided because these are all sugars or sugar alternatives.Carob powder, Maltose/malt, Aspartame, Dextrose/ crystallized dextrin, Mannitol, Galactose, Disaccharides, Maltitol, Monosaccharides, Sorghum, Xylitol, Corn starch, Maltodextrin, Suamiel, Levulose, and Sucanat.\n","Reduce your gluten intake.\n","Most people who suffer from yeast infections of the lungs are naturally intolerant to gluten. Gluten is an elastic protein that is present in triticale, oats, rye, wheat and barley. It is also present in baked goods.[6]Gluten grains are actually a food source of the candida yeast because they have a similar structure to sugar and a high glycemic index.\n","Cut back on your alcohol intake.\n","When yeast has infected your body, the yeast actually breaks down carbohydrates you consume and turns it into a form of ethyl alcohol. Drinking more alcohol while this process is occurring will only increase the number of yeast colonies in your body.You should stop drinking alcohol of any kind for at least the first two months of your treatment. If you start drinking again after this time period, it should be in very small amounts.\n","Switch to a yeast-fighting diet.\n","While combating the yeast in your body, you should tailor your diet to help speed up the healing process. While the diet itself is not a definitive cure, it can help neutralize the harm the yeast is causing your body.The average yeast control diet contains little or no sugar, no processed food and very low carbohydrate consumption. High amount of proteins (except those derived from gluten and soya) must be consumed.Eat vegetables like cabbage, lettuce, kale, mustard greens, horseradish, celery, pepper, broccoli, cauliflower, beans, onions, tomatoes and garlic.Cook with coconut, fish, or palm oil, rather than butter.Meat and fat in your diet should be derived from grass fed animals while fish should be free from contamination of mercury.\n","Understand the primary cause of pulmonary yeast infections.\n","Yeast infections are generally the by-product of a weak immune system. People who maintain poor personal hygiene, smoke, or drink excessively are more prone to candida albicans infections. Certain professions and hobbies also increase the risk, such as demolition, construction, landscaping, and spelunking.\n","Recognize the symptoms of pulmonary yeast infections.\n","A pulmonary yeast infection may present like pneumonia that does not improve with antibiotics. Some symptoms to watch for include:[7]Difficulty breathing, especially when climbing stairsCough, usually with yellow or green phlegmFeverChillsHeadacheSharp stabbing pain in your chest that worsens when you take a deep breath or coughLoss of appetiteExcessive sweatingClammy skinConfusion, especially in older patients\n","Be aware of the risks associated with pulmonary yeast infections.\n","When Candida Albicans affects the lungs, your entire body can actually be affected.

The size of the chunks doesn't really matter, but something between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5.1cm) would work great. Don't use whole beets, because they won't release enough dye.[1]You don't want to cut the beets too small. If you do, the pieces will be harder to remove later on.\n","Place the beets into a pot, then fill the pot with water.\n","How much water you use will depend on the size of the pot. Use enough water to fill the pot 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) from the rim.[2]You will be boiling the water shortly, so the temperature does not matter.\n","Place white cotton or linen fabric into a separate pot.\n","The pot needs to be large enough for the fabric to be able to move around freely. For best results, use something made from white cotton or linen.[3]It would be a good idea to wash and dry the fabric beforehand. This will remove any chemicals that might prevent the dye from adhering.Natural dye does not stick well to synthetics, so use natural fibers, such as cotton or linen.You can use this method to dye articles of clothing as well, as long as they are made from white cotton or linen.\n","Fill the clothing pot with a 1-to-4 ratio of vinegar-to-water.\n","Fill the pot about a quarter of the way with vinegar first. Push the fabric into the vinegar to ensure that it's soaked through, then fill the remaining three-quarters of the pot with water.[4]You are only doing this for the pot that has the fabric in it. Don't add anything to the pot with the beets in it.The vinegar will act as a fixative and help the dye adhere better to the fabric.Alternatively, use 1/2 cup (150 g) of salt for every 8 cups (1.9L) of water.\n","Bring both pots to a boil on the stove.\n","Set each pot down on a separate burner. Turn the heat up to medium or medium-high, then wait for the water to come to a boil. This may take a few minutes.[5]Wait for both pots to come to a boil before moving on to the next step.\n","Reduce the heat to low, then let both pots simmer for 1.5 to 2.5 hours.\n","Again, you want this to happen simultaneously for both pots. Turn the knobs for both burners to low, then wait for the water to reduce to a simmer. Set the timer for anywhere between 1.5 and 2.5 hours.[6]The longer you let the water simmer, the brighter the color will be.\n","Empty the water from the fabric pot.\n","Use a wooden spoon, or something similar, to hold the fabric in place as you pour out the vinegar water. Don't worry if there is some liquid left in the pot.[7]Don't empty the water from the dye pot.\n","Remove the beets from the dye pot.\n","You can use a regular spoon to do this, but a slotted spoon would work even better. Discard the beets or save them for a recipe.[8]Save the red dye leftover from the beets. Don't dump this out.\n","Pour the dye into the fabric pot, then stir the dye.\n","Be sure to pour the dye slowly so that it doesn't splash. Next, stir the pot to ensure that everything is submerged; you may have to poke the folds of fabric to get them to stay down.[9]You won't be able to fill the fabric pot all the way. This is because some of the beet water evaporated while you cooked it.\n","Soak the fabric off-heat in the dye for 12 to 24 hours.\n","There is no need to soak it for longer than that. Make sure that the fabric is fully submerged, however, or it may not dye evenly. If you need to, weigh the fabric down with a plate, bowl, or jar.[10]Take the pot off the stove for this. Dont let the dye bath keep simmering for these 12 to 24 hours.\n","Remove the fabric from the dye bath and squeeze it.\n","Do not rinse the fabric, or you may lose some of that beautiful, vibrant color. Just pull the fabric out and gently squeeze the excess dye from it.[11]It might be a good idea to wear plastic gloves for this step. The beet water may stain your hands for a few days.[12]If you don't mind a lighter shade of pink, you can rinse the fabric in cool water.\n","Dry the fabric in the hot sun or in a dryer.\n","Heat is key to setting the dye into the fabric. If you live in a warm, sunny climate, drying the fabric outside work the best. Otherwise, toss the fabric into the dryer, and dry it on a low-heat setting.[13]If you are drying the fabric outside, keep a pot or bucket under it to catch any drips of dye.[14]\n","Iron the fabric for 5 minutes to further set the dye.\n","Adjust your iron to a no-steam, low-heat setting. Place the fabric on the ironing board, then iron it for about 5 minutes. Not only will this help further set the dye into the fabric, but it will also smooth out wrinkles.[15]Even though your fabric is made from cotton or linen, you should still use a low-heat or warm setting on your iron. Don't use the cotton or linen setting.There is a chance that some of the dye may transfer to the ironing board. Consider covering the board with an old, clean cloth first.\n","Hand wash the fabric in cold water only when necessary.\n","Even with the added vinegar, this is a natural dye. It is safer for the environment than regular dye, but it is not permanent.

There is no need for the dealer to do so.\n","Decide whether to raise your wager against the dealer.\n","Now that you've seen the quality of your 3-card hand, you decide whether to Play (or Raise) your Ante bet, or whether to Fold:In order to have the Ante bet stand, you must place an equal amount of money on the space designated Play.If you decide to Fold instead, the dealer takes your Ante bet and you cannot win that wager.In some casinos, folding will forfeit your Pair Plus bet as well, if you made one.[5]\n","Reveal all hands.\n","Once all players who made an Ante bet have Played or Folded, all hands are turned face up.If a player Folded and did not place a Pair Plus bet, the dealer usually takes his cards before hands are turned face up, since that player has no wager left standing.\n","Determine Ante/Play payout.\n","Any player who Played (Raised) their Ante bet compares his hand to the dealer and has a chance to win a payout according to the casino rules. If playing at home, use the following typical rules:[6]If the dealer's hand is High Card Jack or lower (\"Jack High\"), the dealer pays each player equal to that player's Ante bet (\"even money\") and returns each player's Ante and Play bets.If the dealer's hand is High Card Queen or better (\"Queen High\"), but worse than a player's hand, the dealer pays that player an amount equal to the player's Ante and Play bets combined and returns those bets.If the dealer has Queen High or a better hand, and exactly equal to a player's hand, the dealer returns that player's Ante and Play bets but pays no money.If the dealer has Queen High or better and beats a player's hand, the dealer keeps that player's Ante and Play bets.\n","Determine Pair Plus payout.\n","Separate from the Ante Payout, each player who made a Pair Plus bet gets a reward based on their hand quality. The dealer's hand does not matter for this prize. If playing at home, use the following popular payout system[7] (a 3:1 reward means the player wins 3 times their pair plus bet):Pair Plus RewardHandPayoutStraight Flush 40:1Three of a Kind 30:1Straight 6:1Flush 3:1Pair 1:1High Card Player loses bet\n","Learn the Hand Rankings.\n","The hand ranking system is the same as in the casino game. If you know ordinary poker hand rankings, the only difference is that a straight is worth more than a flush. Here are the full rankings from highest to lowest:[8]3 of a Kind. All 3 cards have the same point value or the same face printed on the card.Straight Flush. The 3 cards are in sequential point value and of the same suit.Flush. The 3 cards are all of the same suit.Straight. The 3 cards are in sequential point value.Pair. Any 2 of the 3 cards have the same face point value.High Card. The 3 cards do not match any of the groupings above. The highest value card is the value of the hand.\n","Agree on the rules of play.\n","Decide whether the Ace will only be used as the highest card in the deck, or whether it may be alternately be used as a 1 when forming a straight.In order to play with any other additional \"house rules\", every player must agree to them before the game begins.\n","Deal one card to each player.\n","You can decide who deals first randomly or through mutual agreement.Deal these cards face down and clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's left.Players may look only at their own card.\n","The player on the dealer's left may place a bet.\n","Play moves clockwise from that player. Before the first bet has been made, each player has three options:Open the betting. The player places any amount of money (or other wagered items) in the center of the table (in the pot).Check. The player does not bet at this time but is still in this round.Fold. The player withdraws from the current round. She takes no more actions until the next hand is dealt.Note: If every player checks, skip straight to dealing the next card.You may wish to agree on a minimum or maximum bet.\n","Once a bet has been made, play continues clockwise.\n","The players now have three options:Call. The player matches the amount of the previously made bet, placing that amount in the pot.Raise. The player matches the amount of a previously announced bet, and adds an additional amount of money to it (their choice).Fold. As before, the player withdraws from this round.\n","Once all remaining players have Called, deal a second card.\n","Deal the cards face down to each player, starting with the player to the dealer's left.Each player should add the new card to their (now 2-card) hand and keep them secret from other players.\n","Bet again.\n","Repeat the wagering process until all of the remaining players have called or checked.[9]\n","Deal a third card.\n","This final card is added to each player's hand.\n","Repeat the betting.\n","Each remaining player has the option to Call, Raise, or Fold until a full circuit of the table has Called.If all but one player decides to Fold, the remaining player wins the pot.\n","Reveal all hands.\n","Players lay their cards face up on the table.

If two players have the same type of hand, whoever has the highest ranked card wins.The one exception comes up when comparing two hands of pairs. In this case the highest pair wins, not the highest cards. (For example, a 4-4-6 beats 2-2-10).\n","Rotate dealers and play another round.\n","The player to the previous dealer's left shuffles together all the cards and begins the next round.\n","Play rounds until the players decide to stop.\n","A player may walk away at any time or the players may mutually decide to stop. There is no required number of hands that must be played.\n","How to Measure Commercial Square Footage: A 3-Part Guide\n","Compare measurement techniques.\n","Landlords may use several different measurement techniques to assess the square footage of a space. These methods include:Useable square footage, or USF: This is the space the tenant actually occupies. Rental agents often quote this figure to prospective renters, but it represents only part of the lease arrangement.Rentable square footage, or RSF: This is the combination of the useable square footage and a percentage of the common-area square footage of the building. Common areas, which are parts of a building all tenants benefit from, include the lobby, elevators, hallways and stairwells.Gross square footage, or GSF: The entire rentable square footage of a building.\n","Decide what method of calculating commercial space is best for you.\n","The Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) simplified industry standards for measuring rentable space in commercial buildings in 2010. The BOMA's 2 leading methods are Method B and Legacy Method A.Method B: The new Single Load Factor Method calculates the rentable space for each tenant using a uniform approach in measuring floor area. It is the same for all floor levels of a building.Legacy Method A: The 1996 standard uses separate unit prices for the USF and common square footage. In some cases, it may be beneficial for tenants to opt for this approach.[1]\n","Choose a measurement method based on the property type.\n","Typically, the measurement technique used will depend on the intended usage of the property and the planned number of tenants. Office buildings, shopping centers, and other multi-tenant buildings will typically be measured using RSF. Single-tenant buildings like warehouses or production facilities are measured using GSF. However, landlords may not be required to use a specific method to measure a space.\n","Consider regional leasing standards.\n","Federal law allows landlords to measure rentable space using any method they desire. However, certain parts of the country may have different rules for calculating square footage. Two notable examples are:The Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY) allows building owners to maximize profits by letting them bring RSF as close as possible to GSF.Tropical areas: New rules account for enclosed and open areas of commercial buildings in areas normally affected by specific weather conditions.\n","Take nothing for granted.\n","Measure the useable space yourself. A miscalculation in determining square footage can cost you thousands of dollars over the duration of the lease. Typical measurement standards allow for a 2 percent error tolerance when measuring commercial space. However, this can translate to a lot of money, especially in large or expensive spaces. Make sure to measure the area as carefully as possible, especially if you are the tenant that might be negatively affected by these miscalculations.\n","Measure simple square footage.\n","To measure commercial square footage for a rectangular space, multiply the length of the room in feet by its width. For example, a room that is 12 feet  long by 12 feet wide is 144 square feet. For L-shaped or divided spaces, you can measure rectangles of space independently and then sum the areas to get a total area measurement.Measurements may be taken using a tape measure or laser measuring device.\n","Account for unusual shapes.\n","Take care when measuring irregularly-shaped sections of a room. To conduct your measurement, try splitting the room into shapes with easy-to-calculate areas, such as rectangles and triangles. The area of a right triangle can be found by multiplying the lengths of the two non-diagonal sides (those two joined by the right angle) and then dividing the product by 2.For example, if there is a room with a diagonal wall running through it, you must use a more-complicated formula to determine the area's square footage. If the length of the space with the diagonal wall was 10 feet and its width was 8 feet, the square footage of the area would be 40 feet.That is because the wall cuts the total square footage, which would have been 80 if the room had no wall intersecting it, in half.\n","Measure common areas.\n","Common areas should be measured so that rentable square feet can be calculated. Common area square footage is measured using the same methods as usable square footage unless otherwise provided for in local laws. Common areas might include elevators, bathrooms, lobbies, stairwells, and hallways. Importantly, common areas must be available to all tenants to use or benefit from. Make sure to measure the total square footage of all common areas in the building.[2]\n","Finding gross square footage.\n","Gross square footage measures the total area of the space, including the thickness of exterior walls. To measure this area, you will need to measure wall length from the outside of the building and use those dimensions to calculate square footage. GSF is not reduced for obstructions such as ventilation shafts, support beams, or elevator shafts. GSF does not include open areas such as parking lots, pools, or unexcavated basement areas.\n","Calculate load factor for the building.\n","The load factor represents the additional percentage of square footage added to usable square footage to calculate rentable square footage. To calculate load factor, start by finding the total usable and rentable square footages of the building in questions. Remember that the usable square footage is the area that can be rented to tenants and the rentable square footage is that area plus common areas. Then, divide RSF by USF to get the load factor.[3]For example, if a building has 80,000 square feet of usable space and an additional 20,000 square feet of common areas, the rentable square footage would be 100,000.Then, the load factor would be calculated as 100,000 / 80,000 = 1.25.\n","Finding rentable square footage for a property.\n","The rentable square footage for a property can be calculated using the building's load factor and USF of the property. The load factor is multiplied by the USF to get the RSF. You can then use the RSF and price per square foot to figure out the monthly rent.[4]Continuing with the previous example, imagine that the property is divided in half between two commercial spaces. So, each one has 40,000 square feet of usable space.To find RSF, multiply this amount by the load factor, which is 1.25. This means that the RSF in this case would be 40,000 x 1.25 = 50,000.\n","Weigh the differences in commercial properties.\n","Unit prices can vary widely based on the location and class of the building. The rent on a 500 square foot (46.5 square m) office downtown might run higher than the rent on a 1,000 square foot space (92.9 square m) only 10 blocks away. Buildings fall into 1 of 3 standard classifications.Class A: These are the most prestigious buildings in the most-exclusive sections of a city.  Class A buildings command higher rents than average.Class B: This is the broadest classification. Most of these buildings have fair to good finishes.Class C: Units in this class are highly functional but offer few amenities. Rents are generally low.[5]\n","Calculate total rent for a property based on square footage.\n","Rents are typically based on a space's RSF or GSF. Once you have this data, you can use the market price per square foot to determine a rent price for the property. Continuing with the example above, if rent were $1.50 per square foot of RSF per month, the rent would be $1.50 x 50,000 = $75,000.[6]\n","How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Homeschool: 11 Steps\n","Write out a list of reasons why you want to be homeschooled.\n","Think about why you want to be homeschooled. Make sure you have a clear reason (or set of reasons) that you can explain to your parents when the time comes.[1]Stating your reasons and explaining how they line up with your values is a good negotiation tactic.There are lots of reasons students give for wanting to switch to homeschool: not being challenged (or being too challenged) by the material in school, being bullied by classmates, struggling to focus, or feeling unsafe or anxious in the classroom.[2]\n","Research different homeschooling styles.\n","To really convince your parents that this is the right option for you, you need to prove that you have a solid grasp of what it actually means to be homeschooled. Read reviews, ask questions on homeschooling forums, talk to other homeschooled kids or parents in your community, and figure out which program (or mix of programs) fits well with your learning style.[3]Some of the options include: complete curriculum packages from companies like Oak Meadow or Calvert, virtual schooling, and interest-led learning. [4]When thinking about what option is best for you, also consider the amount of time and money you think your parents can contribute.\n","Outline your academic goals for being homeschooled.\n","Think about what kinds of things youd like to accomplish during your first year of homeschooling. Chart your goals, including the types of records youll need to keep, how you intend to chart your progress, and what books and resources you might need.[5]Your parents can also help you with this. Let them know youre putting together a plan to show them how much youll be able to learn and achieve in homeschool.\n","Find the right time to present your plan to your parents.\n","Dont spring this conversation on your parents with no warning. Mention in advance that youd like to talk to them about homeschooling, then suggest a time later that day or week when everyone has the time to sit down and concentrate on the discussion.\n","Create a visual aid to help with the conversation.\n","Put together the research that youve gathered into an easy-to-understand format like a Powerpoint or poster. This will add an air of maturity and preparation to your request. Plus, it can help you stay on-topic if you get nervous or flustered during the conversation.[6]Consider including a recommended reading list for your parents. Include books by well-known proponents of homeschooling such as Grace Llewellyn, John Gatto, and John Holt.[7]\n","Stay calm and mature during the conversation.\n","If your parents react negatively to your request, it can be easy to get angry or upset. But throwing a tantrum or screaming at your parents will make it harder for them to believe that youre responsible enough to handle your own education.If things get heated, take a break and restart the conversation at a later time once things have calmed down. You might say, \"I'm going to wait until we're all feeling a little bit calmer because I think the conversation will go better. Thank you for being willing to listen to melet's talk later.\"\n","Dont expect an answer right away.\n","Switching to homeschool is a major decision for both you and your parents. They will likely need some time to think about the decision. Your request to be homeschooled might make your parents sad at first, or make them worry that theyve failed you as a parent. Give them some time to work through their feelingsand the logistics of switching to homeschooling.\n","Refute common myths about homeschooling.\n","Although homeschooling is an increasingly accepted alternative to other forms of schooling, there are many misconceptions that still exist about the practice.[8] See if you can debunk any of the concerns they may have.One of the biggest misconceptions about homeschooling is that it leads to underdeveloped social skills. Research has shown, however, that homeschooled children actually have significantly lower problem-behavior scores than those enrolled in conventional school.[9]Or, if your parents are worried that homeschool students are less likely to get accepted to college, tell them that 74% of homeschool students will earn college credits, compared to 46% of their conventionally-schooled peers.[10]\n","Talk about low-cost or free alternatives, if they are worried about money.\n","Your parents might be concerned about the extra costs associated with homeschooling. Work together to figure out a cost-effective way to homeschoolfor instance, you could borrow or rent curriculum packages from friends or a homeschool support group, instead of buying them outright.Consider offering to pay for some of the textbooks yourself, using income from a summer job or allowance money you have saved.[11]\n","Figure out a plan that works with your parents schedules.\n","Your parents may be worried about fitting in time to teach youespecially if they work a full-time job. Talk to them about the various solutions other families have found to this problem. Do your research to see what homeschool resources are available in your area that can help make it easier for your parents.Some families collaborate with other families and trade kids on different days; others use homeschool cooperatives or university model homeschool academies, where kids actually attend class for part of the week.[12]\n","Compromise with your parents.\n","If your parents arent on board with your original plan, figure out why, specifically, they turned you down. Think about which issues you will need to address to turn their no into a yes. Figure out if you can find a middle ground.[13]Consider proposing a trial period during summer break, for example. Your parents would get a taste of what homeschooling was like without having to commit.\n","How to Use WhatsApp (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Install Whatsapp\n",".

[3]Start by standing in front of a mirror to look at your breasts, with your hands on your hips (as this optimizes the positioning of your breasts so that you can look at them and compare them). [4] Things to look for include: breasts that are similar to their normal in terms of size, shape, and color; no swelling; no skin changes; no nipple discharge or nipple changes; and no redness or soreness.The next step in your breast self-exam is to raise your arms above your head, and to examine your breasts for the same features listed above. [5] This change in position of your arms alters how your breasts sit, and is another way to identify any changes.The next part of the breast self-exam is done lying down. [6] Lift your right arm over your head. With your left hand, apply firm pressure to your right breast. Move your fingers in a circular motion around the nipple, the surrounding tissue and the armpit. [7] Be sure to cover the full surface area of the breast, from the collarbone to the bottom of the rib cage, and from the armpit to the breastbone. Raise your left arm and repeat the process examining your left breast, surrounding tissue and the armpit with your right hand.Doing a breast exam in the shower also works. [8] You may actually be better at reading your breast when your fingers are wet and soapy as your fingers will glide over your breast tissue more easily.\n","Talk with your doctor if you feel new lumps (most are pea-sized) or firm and hard breast tissue.\n","If you do find one, don't fret; odds are it's not cancerous  eight out of 10 aren't. [9] The benign ones are usually caused by cysts, a fibroadenoma, or just generalized breast lumpiness.It's not unusual to develop breast lumps for a short duration of time; most often, these are related to the menstrual cycle (they are called \"physiological breast lumps\" and come and go each month in sync with your menstrual cycle).In order to distinguish \"physiological breast lumps\" (related to your period) from worrisome ones, watch to see whether the lump grows and then shrinks again within the month, and whether this pattern repeats monthly with your cycle. If this is not the case, or if the lump continues to grow, it is always best to seek the advice of your physician.The best time to do breast self-examination is one week before your period starts (as this is the time when it is least likely, hormonally, to have lumps related to your period). If you are post-menopausal or have irregular periods, you can examine your breasts on the same day of each month to keep your self-examination process as consistent as possible.\n","Pay close attention to breast lumps that suddenly grow or change in shape.\n","Most women have inconsistencies in breast tissue (it is the nature of how our breasts are), but if this changes over time (or grows) it is more likely to be worrisome. Also, you can assess one breast in comparison to the other  if both breasts feel the same, it is not a worry, but if one breast has a lump that is definitely not present in the other, this is more of a cause for concern. [10]\n","Be aware of other concerning symptoms.\n","These symptoms may or may not occur in conjunction with a breast lump; if they do, the lump is more likely to be worrisome and it is best to see a physician sooner rather than later. [11]Look for a bloody or pus-like nipple discharge.Watch for a red or pink rash near or around the nipple.Notice any changes in your nipple, especially if it becomes inverted.Observe breast skin. If it becomes thick, scaly, dry, dimpled, red or pink, talk to your doctor.\n","Call your family doctor if you are unsure whether your breast lump is of concern.\n","It is always best to have reassurance that things are fine, or the proper series of investigations and tests as soon as possible if your doctor agrees that there is cause for concern.Medical professionals are well-trained in how to evaluate and assess breast lumps, and in particular in how to rule out breast cancer. [12] If in doubt, do not hesitate to ask for doctors advice.Breast cancer is a realistic concern for many women (being the number one most frequent cancer diagnosis in women). [13] One in nine women are diagnosed with breast cancer in their life, so if in doubt get your breast lump checked out by a doctor sooner rather than later. Most breast lumps are benign (not worrisome), and many cancer diagnoses are completely treatable if caught sooner rather than later.Keep in mind, however, that breast cancer under the age of 20 is very rare, and it is very uncommon under the age of 30.\n","Set up a mammography appointment.\n","Do this on an annual basis or as prescribed by your doctor. This is a low-dose X-ray examination used for locating breast tissue abnormalities.Mammograms are the number one way in which breast cancers are caught and diagnosed. [14] It can be used as a screening test (routine test for any woman over the age of 40 to rule out breast cancer even without symptoms or lumps), and also as a diagnostic test (for women with a breast lump to gather further information to determine whether or not the lump is of concern).For a young patient with dense breast tissue, however, an MRI may be a better test than mammogram.People who receive a mammogram for diagnostic reasons (to determine whether or not their breast lump is worrisome) will likely also receive additional tests to add to the information your doctor has to work with, to determine whether or not she is concerned about your breast lump.\n","Proceed with a breast ultrasound for further investigation of your lump if your physician recommends this.\n","[15] Ultrasound provides a different viewpoint of the breast than mammography, and can help to differentiate between solid and cystic masses (cystic masses are generally fluid-filled and not of concern; in other words, not cancerous).An ultrasound can also provide further information to see whether a biopsy (sample of the breast tissue taken with a needle and examined by doctors under the microscope) is needed. [16]\n","Have your physician prescribe a breast lump biopsy if the other test results are unable to rule out breast cancer.\n","[17] A sample of your breast tissue will be examined under a microscope, which can give a definite answer as to whether the lump is benign (non-worrisome) or malignant (cancerous).If the lump is in fact diagnosed as breast cancer, you will be referred to an oncologist (cancer specialist) and perhaps a surgeon for surgical, hormonal, or chemotherapy treatments, depending upon the severity.Again, it is important to be aware that the great majority of breast lumps are not cancer; [18] however, it is always best to see your physician and to have the recommended tests done in order to rule out any possibility, and to get treatment as soon as possible (which results in the most successful outcomes) if you are in fact diagnosed with breast cancer.At times, a breast MRI or ductogram will be used as \"diagnostic tests\" by your doctor, but these are significantly less common than mammograms, ultrasounds, and breast biopsies. [19]\n","Follow-up as per your doctor's advice.\n","[20] Oftentimes, if a breast lump is determined to be not particularly concerning, your doctor will ask that you continue to monitor it over time and to report back if there are any significant changes or growth. Most often there will not be, but it is always better to be safe rather than sorry and to continue paying attention to any lumps or different textures to your breast to see if these change or worsen with time (at which point a follow-up visit to your family doctor is recommended).\n","How to Install an Outdoor Outlet (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Find an indoor receptacle to connect to on the wall where you want the exterior outlet.\n","Look around the outside of your home for an area where you want to place the outlet, such as on a porch or patio. Once you find the spot where you want to place the outlet, go inside your home and find the nearest outlet on the other side of the exterior wall. Be sure to choose an outlet that isn't switch-operated or else the exterior outlet won't work when you plug into it.[1]If you don't have an inside outlet on the wall where you want the exterior outlet, then hire an electrician to run wires from your circuit box to the spot.Rather than connecting to an existing receptacle, you can also run the outlet back to your circuit breaker.[2]\n","Turn off the power at the circuit box for the outlet that you're connecting to.\n","Locate the breaker inside your circuit box that controls the interior outlet and flip the switch to the off position. Put an outlet tester in the plug to see if it still has a current running through it. If none of the lights turn on when you plug the tester in, then it's disconnected from power and you can continue working.[3]Try the outlet tester in a plug that you know works to make sure the tester functions properly.Never work on an outlet when it's still connected to power since you could electrocute yourself.If some of the lights still turn on when you plug the tester in, then the outlet is still live and you turned off the wrong breaker. Continue testing the breakers until the tester says the outlet has no power.\n","Remove the outlet from the wall to access the box behind it.\n","Use a screwdriver to remove the cover plate on the outlet and set it aside. Unscrew the screws on the top and bottom of the outlet to loosen it from the wall. Once you remove the screws from the outlet, carefully pull it out from the wall so the wires stay attached to it.[4]Keep the screws for your outlet in a small container so you don't misplace them while you're working.\n","Drill straight through the back of the outlet box and siding.\n","Position the end of a 12in (30cm) drill bit through the hole at the back of the outlet box, making sure it doesn't touch any wires. Turn the drill on and slowly push through the wall behind the outlet box. Continue pushing the drill bit through the wall until you feel it pop out through the exterior wall and through your siding.[5]If you can't drill through the back of the outlet box, then drill the hole next to the top corner of the box so you can still easily access the wires.If the inside outlet is less than 1 foot (30cm) from the ground, angle your drill bit up so it comes out higher on the exterior wall. Never place an exterior outlet less than 1 foot (30cm) from the ground since it could easily be exposed to moisture.If you're drilling through concrete or brick, use a drill bit meant for masonry.\n","Feed a 12/2 cable through the hole in your outlet box.\n","A 12/2 cable contains a live, neutral, and ground wire inside so you can easily attach an outlet to it. Push the 12/2 cable through the hole you just drilled so there's 5 inches (13cm) of excess on the inside and outside of your home. Cut the cable to size with a pair of wire cutters.You can buy 12/2 cables from your local hardware store.\n","Strip 34in (7.610.2cm) off the interior end of the 12/2 cable.\n","Clamp the jaws of a 12/2 cable stripper 34 inches (7.610.2cm) from the end of the cable and squeeze the handles together. Pull the stripper toward the end of the cable to cut through the insulation and expose the 3 wires inside. Pull any leftover insulation off the 12/2 cable if it doesn't come off with the stripper.[6]You can get a 12/2 stripper from your local hardware store.\n","Expose 1in (2.5cm) on the end of each wire inside the 12/2 cable.\n","The 12/2 cable contains a black wire, a white wire, and an exposed copper wire. Grip the black wire 1 inch (2.5cm) from the end with a pair of wire strippers and pull them toward you to remove the insulation. Repeat the process on the white wire so you can attach them to the outlet.[7]Sometimes, the ground wire may have green insulation around it. If there's a green wire in the cable, strip it as well.\n","Loop the black wire clockwise around the live screw on the outlet.\n","Use a pair of needlenose pliers to bend the end of the black wire into a loop. Locate the black screw on the side of the outlet and position the loop you made underneath the screw head. Make sure the loop goes clockwise around the screw so it has a full connection. Tighten the black screw to secure the live wire in place.[8]Check the back of your interior outlet to see if it has ports where you can plug additional wires in. That way, you don't need to loop the wire around the screw but it will still get power.\n","Secure the white wire around the silver neutral screw.\n","Bend the end of the white wire into a small circle with a pair of needlenose pliers. Loop the wire around the silver screw on the opposite side of the outlet so it goes clockwise. Tighten the screw with a screwdriver to secure the wire in place.[9]Put the wire in the back of the outlet behind the silver screw if there's a port so you don't have to wrap it around the screw.\n","Wrap the ground wire from the 12/2 cable around the one attached to the outlet.\n","Straighten the end of the exposed copper wire from the 12/2 line with your pair of pliers and line it up with the ground wire connected to the top or bottom of the outlet. Twist the wire from the 12/2 cable around the ground wire on the outlet by hand so it has a secure connection.[10]If the ground wire attached to the outlet has insulation around it, then wrap the end of the ground wire around the screw on the top or bottom of the outlet.\n","Secure the interior outlet back in place.\n","Push the outlet and wires back into the outlet box inside your wall. Line up the screws on the top and bottom of the outlet and secure them in place with your screwdriver. Put the cover over the outlet and screw it back in so all the wires are inside your wall.[11]Don't turn on your breaker for the outlet yet since the wires on the other side of the 12/2 cable are still exposed.\n","Screw an exterior outlet box to the outside wall so it lines up with the hole.\n","Be sure to get an outlet box that's meant for exterior use. Guide the end of the 12/2 cable through the hole in the middle of the exterior box and push the box against your siding. Locate the screw holes in the back of the box and drive screws into your siding to secure it tightly in place.[12]You can buy exterior outlet boxes from your local hardware or home improvement store.If you have brick exterior walls, position the screws so they go through the middle of the bricks rather than through the mortar.\n","Buy a GFCI outlet that's approved for outdoor use.\n","GFCI outlets have a failsafe on them so they immediately stop working when they get wet. Look for a GFCI outlet that's rated for outdoor use or else it may not be safe to use. Make sure that the outlet fits inside the exterior box you attached to the wall so it's protected from the elements.[13]You can buy GFCI outlets from your local hardware store.\n","Strip 34 inches (7.610.2cm) off the end of the 12/2 cable to expose the wires inside.\n","Clamp your 12/2 stripper so it's 34 inches (7.610.2cm) from the end of the cable. Pull the stripper toward the end of the cable to remove the outer insulation around the 3 wires inside it. Pull the wires apart to separate them so they're easier to work with.[14]You can also slice down the middle of the 12/2 cable with a utility knife and peel back the insulation to expose the wires.\n","Remove 12in (2.55.1cm) of insulation from the live and neutral wires.\n","Grip the black wire 1 inch (2.5cm) from the end with a pair of wire strippers. Pull the stripper toward the end of the wire to remove the insulation and expose the copper wire inside. Repeat the process with the white wire so you can attach it to the neutral screw.[15]Remove the green insulation from the ground wire if it has it.\n","Attach each of the wires to their corresponding screws.\n","Wrap the end of the black wire around the black screw and the white wire on the silver screw. Attach the end of the copper ground wire to the green screw that's either on the top or bottom of the outlet. Make sure the loops go around the screws clockwise so the current can travel at full strength. Once all the wires are attached, tighten all of the screws so they have a secure connection.[16]Your outlet may have ports on the back where you can plug the wires in rather than wrapping them around the screws.\n","Screw the outlet into the exterior box to hold it in place.\n","Hold the outlet inside of the exterior box so the screwholes line up with one another and so the wires are tucked in the back of the box. Use either wood screws or masonry anchors depending on whether you have wood or concrete exterior walls. Tighten the screws on the outlet to the sides of the box so it's secured in place.Some exterior boxes allow you to screw the outlets directly into them so you don't need to put more screws in your siding.\n","Turn on the power to the outlet to test if it works.\n","Flip the switch on your circuit box so your outlets have power again. Plug your outlet tester into the indoor and outdoor outlets to see if they're working. Check the key on top the tester to determine if the wiring for your outlets are correct.If the outlets still aren't working or the tester shows the wiring is wrong, turn off the circuit again and check the wires.\n","How to Hit a Cart Without a Battery: Step-by-Step Guide\n","Cut off the phone-charging end of a USB cable.\n","Make sure the USB cable is unplugged, first! Use scissors to cut off the end of the cable that youd stick into your phone.[1] Find an old cable you dont need, since you wont be able to use it again after this.For this method, the USB cable must be an Android cable (USB 3.0 or USB C). IPhone cables are wired differently and wont provide the spark you need.Always practice caution when working with electrical wires. While not strong enough to cause serious injury, a live USB wire may still give you a bit of a shock if handled improperly. Never cut a plugged-in cable.\n","Trim away the rubber or plastic cable sleeve.\n","With your scissors, make a shallow incision all the way around the cable about 23in (5.17.6cm) from the end you cut off, slicing through the cables protective sleeve but keeping the wires inside intact.[2] Then, slide off the end of the sleeve, exposing the wires inside.All USB cables have a red and a black wire. Your cable might also have a green or white wire, but these arent necessary for this methoduse your scissors to cut them away.\n","Use a nail trimmer or wire strippers to strip the black and red wires.\n","One at a time, and with a more delicate tool, carefully pinch the coating of the interior wires, about 0.5in (1.3cm) from the end.[3] Then, pull the coating off the end using your nail trimmers to expose the bare wire underneath.To  use wire strippers, place the end of the wire inside the smallest hole on the strippers teeth, then pull the strippers along the wire toward the end.Be careful not to cut through the wire itself! If you do, simply use your scissors to expose more of the wire further down the cable, then try again.\n","Connect the black wire to the carts power port.\n","Find the small hole on the bottom on your cart, where it would typically connect to a pen. Feed the stripped end of the black wire into this hole, making sure that the exposed wire is as far in as you can. If you like, hold it in place with some electrical tape.[4]\n","Touch the end of the red wire to the metal on the cart.\n","Take the exposed end of the red wire and touch it to any metal section on the cart itself. The base of the cart is typically made of metal, so thatll do fine.[5] Now that both wires are connected, the cart will get power once the USB cord is plugged in.Be careful not to touch the exposed ends of the wire together, which may create sparks or cause a small shock.\n","Plug in the USB cable and hit the cart.\n","Connect the intact end of the USB cable to a device like a laptop. As soon as its plugged in, your cart is activated.[6]  Take a hit from the cart, then immediately unplug the cable to conserve your oil, since the plugged-in cable is continuously providing power and heating the oil inside the cart. Plug it back in when youre ready to take another hit.Avoid plugging the cable into a wall charger, as these tend to provide a stronger electrical current, which may damage your cart, or even cause injury.If the cart wont hit with this method, it probably has some electrical defect and cant be hit at all.  Extract the oil from the cart instead to use it in a pipe or a joint.\n","Remove the mouthpiece from the cart.\n","Before you can get at that precious oil trapped inside, you need to get rid of the mouthpiece blocking the way. Simply unscrew the mouthpiece on most carts to expose the top of the cart underneath.[7] If it cant be unscrewed, try prying it off with pliers. If that doesnt work, it may be time to get a new cart altogether.\n","Heat the cart with a hair dryer for 1-2 minutes.\n","Place the cart on a flat surface and hold a hair dryer about 1ft (0.30m) away from it on low heat.[8] This heats the oil in the cart just enough to make it a bit looser and able to be extracted. Heat the cart until the oil flows easily.Alternatively, place the cart in a sealed plastic bag, then place the bag in a bowl of hot water for 5 minutes to loosen the oil.Note that some cartridges dont have a cap with a hole keeping the oil in, and removing the mouthpiece may give you direct access to the oil. If this is the case, keep the mouthpiece on until its time to extract the oil.\n","Use a syringe needle to extract the oil from the cartridge.\n","Push the lever of the syringe all the way down. Then stick the syringe needle through the small hole at the opening at the top of the cartridge, until the needle is touching the oil inside. Pull the syringes lever to retrieve the oil.[9] Shift it around a bit as you do to make sure you get every last drop.If your cart doesn't have a cap, skip the syringe and simply stand the cart upside-down in a small dish, like a medicine cup, to let the oil drip down and collect in the cup.\n","Dab or smoke the oil to use it.\n","Now that youve freed the oil from your cart, use it any number of ways. Add a drop of oil to the dab nail on a bong (or just to a packed bowl) to smoke it, or add a drop to your hash when you  roll a joint for an enhanced pull. Alternatively, add 3-4 drops to your recipes when  making marijuana cookies or  making weed brownies for a more intense edible.\n","How to Sew Sticky Back Velcro: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Cut the Velcro to the size you need for your project and press it onto fabric.\n","[1] Pull off as much sticky back Velcro as you need and cut it to size. Then, pull apart the pieces and peel off the backing before you press a sticky side onto the fabric. Push firmly so the Velcro stays in place.[2]You can hand-sew sticky Velcro on most lightweight fabrics such as cotton or polyester. Avoid using denim since it's too thick to stitch by hand.If you only need to sew a little bit of sticky back Velcro, buy small sticky back coins or squares instead of tape.\n","Thread a heavy-duty needle with polyester thread and knot 1 end.\n","[3] Cut off an 18 to 20 inches (460 to 510mm) long strand of polyester thread that matches your fabric. Insert the thread through the eye of a heavy-duty sewing needle and tie a knot at the other end of the thread.[4]Buy needles that say they're heavy-duty or made for denim on the package.If you use a thin needle, it's more likely to break as you push it through the tough Velcro pieces.\n","Bring the needle through the corner of the Velcro to the front of the fabric.\n","Insert the needle through 1 corner of the Velcro so the knot catches on the Velcro.[5]To make the knot more secure, bring the needle back up through the Velcro and push it down through the same spot you just stitched into.\n","Straight stitch across each edge of the Velcro.\n","Push your needle down through the Velcro to create a straight stitch, also called a running stitch. Then, bring it back up through the Velcro to make another stitch. To finish sewing, make a few backstitches and cut the thread.[6]Repeat this process for the opposite piece of the Velcro.Sew as close to the edges as you can when you're doing the straight stitch, so they don't curl up. Keep your stitches as small as possible so the Velcro stays firmly in place.[7]If you want the Velcro to be extra secure, straight stitch diagonally across the piece.\n","Wipe away adhesive with acetone and lubricate the needle if it begins to stick.\n","Although it's a lot easier to sew sticky back Velcro by hand, the needle might still become sticky from the adhesive.[8] If it does, stop sewing and wipe the needle with a cloth soaked in acetone or nail polish remover. Then, squirt a few drops of sewing machine lubricant onto another cloth and wipe it on the needle.[9]You may need to repeat this every few stitches or at least for every side you sew.\n","Cut the Velcro to the size you need and press it onto fabric.\n","Unroll as much of the sticky back Velcro as you need for your project and cut it. Then, separate the sides and peel off the backing to expose the adhesive. Position the sticky back Velcro on your fabric and press firmly so it sticks in place.[10]Although sticky back Velcro also comes in small coins or squares, these are too small to sew using your machine.To prevent the Velcro's corners from catching on fabric, trim each corner of the Velcro piece at a 120-degree angle.Since a sewing machine can easily stitch through heavy fabrics as well as lightweight ones, you can sew sticky back Velcro onto most fabrics. Just ensure that you have a strong needle so it doesn't break.\n","Lubricate a heavy-duty sewing needle.\n","Since the sticky adhesive can gum up your sewing needle, install a new, heavy-duty needle. Then, squirt a few drops of sewing machine lubricant onto a soft cloth and wipe it on the needle.[11]The package of needles should say \"heavy-duty\" or that they're designed for denim.Set the oiled cloth aside since you'll use it when you begin sewing.\n","Attach a hook and loop footer to your machine if you have one.\n","To make it easier for your machine to sew over the Velcro, snap a hook and loop footer in place. If your machine doesn't have a hook and loop presser foot, use a zipper foot so it doesn't catch on the Velcro.[12]\n","Set your machine to make small stitches so the machine doesn't skip.\n","Place the fabric under your needle so the Velcro faces up. Then, adjust the machine's stitch length to make straight stitches between 1.5 and 2.0 millimetres (0.059 and 0.079in) long. If you make the stitch length longer than this, the needle may skip over the Velcro.[13]Use polyester thread, which is stronger than cotton thread and less likely to break.Don't try to do the zig zag stitch with Velcro since your machine may have a difficult time working back and forth.\n","Stitch around the edges of the Velcro to securely attach it to the fabric.\n","Sticky back Velcro tends to curl up around the edges, so sew straight stitches along each edge of the Velcro piece. Then, sew diagonally across the Velcro piece so it's secure in the center.[14]\n","Wipe down the needle and lubricate it every few stitches.\n","Your needle will get coated with adhesive gunk even though you lubricated it. Stop every 2 or 3 stitches and carefully wipe away the buildup using a cloth soaked in acetone or nail polish remover. Then, wipe the needle with the lubricated cloth you used earlier. To finish sewing, make a few backstitches and cut the thread.[15]Keep both cloths handy since you'll need to stop every few stitches to clean and oil the needle.Repeat this process for the opposite side of the Velcro.\n","Sew slowly so you don't break the needle.\n","Your machine may struggle to stitch through the Velcro even with frequent lubrication. Work as slowly as possible so your needle doesn't gum up or break.[16]If you're still having trouble sewing Velcro with the machine, consider sewing the Velcro by hand.\n","How to Serve a Ping Pong Ball With a Topspin: 9 Steps\n","Serve a ball with no spin.\n","This ball will not travel as fast, but if you are just learning how to play ping pong, it is important you can do this first. [1]Hit the ball near its equator, which is the line just through the exact center of the ball.Make sure you hit it with your racket at a 90 degree angle to the ball.The ball will travel forwards and have little to no spin.\n","Try putting spin on the ball.\n","You can do this after you have mastered a serve with out a spin. [2]Brush your racket on the ball as you serve. This is rubbing the ball slightly as you hit it. The direction of your brush will put a different spin on the ball.Spin is imparted onto a ball by using a tangential brushing action with your racket.Do this with your racket at less than a 90 degree angle.Use an upwards, downwards, or sideways movement.The faster a racket brushes a ping pong ball, the faster it will spin.The ball will spin faster and travel less distance with a good brush.Using paddles or rackets with reverse rubbers can help you impart more spin on the ball, instead of using pimpled or anti-spin rubbers.\n","Learn the different types of spins.\n","There are three main types of spins in ping pong and each has their own technique during a serve. [3]Topspin is produced by starting your stroke below the ball and brushing the racket on the ball in an upwards and forwards motion.Backspin is made by starting your stroke above the ball and brushing the racket against the ball in a downwards and forwards motion.Sidespin is produced by brushing your racket in a sideways motion as you hit the ball.\n","Learn the effects of putting spin on the ball.\n","Using different types of spin have different effects during a pin pong game. [4]When you put topspin on a ball it increases the downwards pressure on the ball, so it will stay low after it hits the table. When this hits the opponents racket, the ball will rebound in an upward direction.When you impart backspin onto a ball, it will bounce up more after it hits the table and not go as far forwards.When a ball from backspin stroke makes contact with the other players racket, the ball rebounds in a downwards direction.When you put side spin on a ball, it will bounce off your opponents racket in the same direction your racket was travelling when you hit the ball. For example, if you brushed left, the ball will rebound to the left.\n","Get into position for a serve.\n","Where you stand will depend on which hand is your dominant hand. [5]If you are right handed, you will stand at the backhand corner of the ping pong table. Put your right foot forward and bend your knees slightly.

Put your left foot forwards and bend your knees slightly. You are now in ready position for a serve.If you are left handed, you should serve with your racket in your left hand and the ball in your right hand.\n","Throw the ball in to the air from an open palm.\n","International ping pong rules state that a ball must be thrown straight up into the air when it is served. You may not serve the ball directly from your hand. [6]When you do this your hand should roughly be at chest level.You must throw the ball into the air at least six inches, or about the height of the net.You should not toss the ball up and forwards or up and backwards towards you. Aim to toss it straight up into the air.\n","Hit the ball for your serve when it comes back down.\n","You should serve when it gets to about chest or belly level.If you serve the ball too low, it wont have enough height on the serve to go over the net.If you serve the ball too high, it might bounce too high or too fast after your serve.Hitting it about chest level or just below will allow the ball to accelerate forward and bounce off of the table and over the net.\n","Strike the top part of the ball, above the ball's equator.\n","If you strike the ball in the wrong spot, it wont spin or it wont have the right type of spin. [7]Keep your paddle at a less than 90 degree angle. Angle the paddle towards the net for a top spin.Remember, hitting the top part of the ball is the first part of putting topspin on a ping pong ball.If you hit the ball at the equator, (right around the middle of the ball) it wont have any spin, and might travel too far forward before hitting the table.If you strike the ball from below you might put a backspin on it, but the goal here is to get a topspin.A top spin will allow a ball to bounce on the table close to the server, away from the net.\n","Brush the ball in an upward and forward motion as you strike, aiming to hit your side of the table as far from the net as possible.\n","This will propel the ball forward quickly. [8]Brushing is how you rub your paddle against the ball quickly as you serve or return. Brushing in different directions will cause different kinds of spin.Remember, brushing your ball upwards and forwards will result in a topspin.If you put a topspin on a ball during a ping pong game, it will stay low after it bounces on the table.This will make the ball harder to hit for your opponent.When your opponent hits a ball with a topspin, it will rebound in an upwards direction.\n","3 Ways to Wash an American Girl Doll's Hair - wikiHow\n","Cover your dolls face and body with plastic so she doesnt get wet.\n","Wrapping a plastic grocery bag around your dolls soft body and face to keep the water off of her.

Molar pregnancies are also more common in women who are younger than 20 or over 45.Your doctor may suggest waiting a year before trying again to get pregnant.[2]Waiting will allow you to fully recover from the last one and to make sure all of the molar tissue was removed. If you get pregnant too soon, you have a higher risk of having another molar pregnancy.\n","Learn about molar pregnancies.\n","Molar pregnancy occurs due to problems that occur during fertilization and result in nonviable embryos. This means that you cannot prevent or cause it. 0.1% to 0.3% of pregnancies are molar.[3]In a complete molar pregnancy, the genetic material from the mothers egg is lost or inactive and the genetic material from the sperm is duplicated.In a partial molar pregnancy, the father provides twice as much genetic material as normal, even though the genetic material from the mother is still there. This can happen if two sperm fertilize one egg.\n","Watch for symptoms of a molar pregnancy.\n","If you are pregnant and have the following symptoms, you should go immediately to the doctor to get checked.[4]Passing cysts through your vagina. They may be as large as grapes.Bleeding from your vagina during the first few months of pregnancy. The blood may be dark brown or fresh and bright red. Bleeding is usually heavier than it would be with a miscarriage, especially if you wait to be seen by a doctor.Nausea or vomiting. This may be so severe that you require hospitalization.A feeling of pressure or discomfort in your abdomen.\n","Get checked by a doctor.\n","If you have had any symptoms of a molar pregnancy, your doctor will examine you for other signs such as:[5]Abnormal levels of the pregnancy hormone HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropinOvarian cystsA uterus that is expanding too fast for the stage of pregnancy you are inAnemiaA raise in blood pressure before 20 weeksPreeclampsia, which is a dangerous condition in which your blood pressure increases and you get protein in your urine.  You may have swelling in your feet and legs.\n","Confirm the diagnosis with an ultrasound.\n","A complete molar pregnancy can be seen on ultrasounds as early as eight weeks into the pregnancy. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the uterus and developing baby.[6]If you have a complete molar pregnancy, the ultrasound may show that no embryo has developed, there is no amniotic fluid, the uterus is filled with a cystic placenta, or ovarian cysts.If you have a partial molar pregnancy, the ultrasound may reveal that the fetus is not growing properly, there is not enough amniotic fluid around the fetus, and the placenta is thick and filled with cysts.\n","Have the cystic tissue removed.\n","Even a partial molar pregnancy cannot develop into a viable fetus and must be removed. The doctor will:[7]Use a technique called dilation and curettage. This is done as an outpatient procedure so you will be able to go home the same day.The doctor will dilate your cervix and insert a small vacuum through your vagina and into your uterus. The vacuum will remove the cystic tissue.\n","Allow the doctor to monitor your HCG levels after the tissue has been removed.\n","The doctor will monitor your levels of HCG or human chorionic gonadotropin, which is how they can tell if all of the tissue is gone and if a cancer is developing after a molar pregnancy. This is why it is absolutely essential you go to your follow up appointments. If your HCG levels do not drop back to normal after treatment, it suggests that all the cystic tissue may not have been removed.[8]Remaining cystic tissue is usually effectively treated with chemotherapy, usually methotrexate. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, dizziness, or temporary hair loss.The doctor may want to continue monitoring your hormone levels for up to a year. Again, it is extremely important you allow your doctor to monitor your HCG levels for as long as they deem necessary.\n","Get emotional support.\n","The emotional effects of losing a fetus and worrying about the risks of developing cancer can be severe.

Try to spread the bananas out as best you can so they aren't bunched up together.[1]As the bananas begin to thaw, they will inevitably leak some liquid, which is why putting them in the bowl is really useful.If you don't have a bowl around, feel free to put the bananas inside a plastic bag. If you froze the bananas in a bag in the first place, you can just use this bag.If you're concerned about flies or other bugs, cover the bowl with foil or plastic wrap.\n","Leave the bananas to sit for 2 hours.\n","Try to time it so that you are ready to use them right as they become fully thawed out. Put the bowl somewhere where it receives a lot of light if you want to make it go a little faster.[2]Letting the bananas sit for 2 hours is just a rough estimate, this may take more time or less time depending on the climate you are in.\n","Take the banana peels off with a paring knife.\n","Flip the bananas upside down so the brown tip is facing upward, and insert your knife at the top. Then, slowly shave down the side of the banana being careful to not take too much flesh of the banana. Shave the peel down and away from you so your hands aren't in danger.[3]Try to use a paring knife for this process as paring knives are really good for peeling and shaping. However, if you don't have one, a regular chef's knife will do just fine.\n","Place the bananas in a plastic bag.\n","If you don't have a plastic bag, try to find another container you can use, such as a plastic bowl or something similar. A paper bag won't work as it will fall apart in the water.[4]The reason for putting the bananas in a bag is so that the water you put the bananas in to defrost doesn't affect the flavor/texture of the bananas. This is particularly important if you peeled the bananas before you froze them.The peels can either be on or off for this process, but it's simpler just to leave them on.\n","Submerge the bag of bananas in a bowl full of cool water.\n","Make sure the water is cool enough that you can put your hands in it comfortably. Take this chance to spread the bananas out so they all have as much exposure to the water as possible.[5]The water acts like a heater here and gently increases the temperature of the bananas to help them defrost.Make sure you fully submerge the bananas in the water.\n","Leave the bananas for about 10 minutes.\n","Feel free to change the water after 5 minutes or so if you want to speed up the process a little bit.[6]Make sure to check how firm the bananas feel before you take them out. Do this by picking one up and squeezing it gently. If it still feels frozen, put it back to continue thawing.\n","Microwave the bananas on low for 3-4 minutes as an alternative.\n","This is an option if you want to thaw your bananas as fast as possible. If you don't have a bag, you can put the bananas in a plastic or ceramic bowl, or some other kind of container. Make sure you don't put any metal in the microwave.[7]The power level of microwaves does vary, so stop the microwave after a few minutes to check how defrosted the bananas are.Make sure that the microwave is definitely set to low, as food items can very easily start to cook in microwaves. The last thing you want is a partially cooked banana!\n","How to Speak French: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Control your tongue movement when saying French words.\n","Due to the lack of diphthongs in French, your tongue moves a lot less than it would if you were speaking English. Too much tongue movement will make your speech sound more heavily accented.[1]Try putting the tip of your tongue against the back of your lower front teeth as you speak. Open your mouth less, and let your lips and jaw do the work of pronouncing the words.Speaking in front of a mirror can help you get your mouth and tongue movements right. You might also try watching native French speakers and attempt to mimic their facial expressions and mouth movements.\n","Practice French sounds that don't exist in English.\n","The letters eu, u, and r make sounds in French that are unlike anything you would say in English. Not being able to pronounce these letters correctly can ruin otherwise good pronunciation.[2]To get the u sound correct, make an eee sound, then round your lips as you would if you were making an ooo sound. Practice this until you can make the u sound without starting with the eee sound.The French r is pronounced from the back of your throat, similar to the ch in the Scottish word \"loch.\"\n","Watch French television shows and mimic the conversations.\n","You can find French television shows streaming online that you can watch for free. Your favorite video-streaming service may also have French-language movies and television shows available. These shows can give you a better idea of how French people actually talk to each other.[3]News programs, game shows, and reality shows give you the opportunity to see non-actors speaking. This can help you learn casual, informal conversation.\n","Use liaisons to make smooth transitions between words.\n","Liaisons are part of the reason that French sounds as smooth and melodic as it does. Rather than harsh endings between words, most French words are blended together using liaisons. This means some letters that normally are silent are pronounced to smooth the transition.For example, take the sentence vous tes dans un grand avion. If you simply pronounced all the words individually, you'd end up with a sentence that sounded something like \"voo ett dahn un grahn ahveeohn.\" While each word is pronounced correctly, that certainly doesn't sound like French. If you say it with liaisons, you would say something more like \"voo zett dahn zun grahn ahveeohn.\"The rules for liaisons aren't always intuitive. It just takes practice to get it right. Generally, try to smooth out your language so that you roll easily from one word to the next.\n","Test yourself with tongue twisters.\n","Tongue twisters can help improve your punctuation and train your tongue and mouth to move properly when pronouncing French words. Start slowly, then gradually increase the speed at which you say the words. Some tongue twisters you can try include:[4]Dans ta tente ta tante t'attend. (\"In your tent, your aunt is waiting for you.\")Pauvre petit pcheur, prend patience pour pouvoir prendre plusieurs petits poissons. (\"Poor little fisherman, be patient in order to fish several little fish.\")Ces cerises sont si sres qu'on ne sait pas si 'cen sont. (\"These cherries are so sour, we're not sure if they are cherries.\")\n","Speak to native French speakers.\n","Chatting with native speakers is the best way to start improving your accent and speaking more naturally and more confidently. If you don't know any native French speakers, you can find conversation partners online. If a native French speaker is interested in practicing English or another language you know, both of you can benefit from the exchange.Watch the facial expressions and mouth movements of native speakers as they converse with you. Try to mimic these facial expressions and movements to improve your pronunciation.Ask your French conversation partner to stop you and correct any errors you make in pronunciation or word choice. This will help you get better.\n","Use common conversational starters.\n","While you can always walk up to a French person and say bonjour or salut, this isn't the most natural way to start a conversation. Think about how a conversation would go if a stranger walked up to you and simply said \"hello.\" Work on your small talk in French and other simple ways to get a real conversation started. Some common opening lines include:[5]C'est joli ici. C'est la premire fois que je viens ici, et vous? (\"How nice it is here. It's my first time here, and you?\")Ahhh, comme il fait beau. Enfin du soleil! C'est bien agrable, vous ne trouvez pas? (\"Ahhh, it's so nice out. Sun, at last! It's so pleasant, don't you agree?\")'Bonjour, on se connat de vue je crois. Je viens souvent ici, il me semble que je t'ai dj aperu. (\"Hello, I've seen you before I think. I come here often, and I believe I've seen you around.\")\n","Ask simple questions in a more natural way.\n","You may have learned that the phrases ce que or ce qu'il are used when asking questions. Native French speakers commonly blend these words together  the c is not pronounced separately. Merging these phrases together will automatically make your speech sound more natural.[6]Instead of qu'est-ce que c'est, for example, you would say qu'est \"skeu\" c'est.When you say il or elle, drop the l sound as well. For example, instead of saying qu'est-ce q'il fait, you would say qu'est \"skee\" fait.\n","Add phrases that will keep the conversation moving.\n","When talking to someone in English, you probably respond to them with basic phrases such as \"is that so\" or \"you don't say.\" These phrases show that you're listening and keep the other person talking. Some similar phrases to use when speaking French include:[7]a va de soi. (\"It goes without saying.\")'est a? (\"Is that right?\")Ah bon? (\"Oh really?\")Mais oui (\"absolutely\") or ben oui (\"well yeah\").Mais non (\"absolutely not\") or ben non (\"well no\").\n","Repeat back what native speakers say to you.\n","When you repeat what a native speaker has just said, it shows them that you were listening and understood what they said. It also gives you an opportunity to practice your French without having to come up with words on your own. You're also learning grammar and word usage through familiarity with the language.For example, suppose your conversation partner said \"Je viens de Paris, et toi?\" (\"I'm from Paris, and you?\") You have a few options for a reply. You could simply say \"Je viens des Etats-Unis,\" if you're from the United States. But if you're using the repetition technique, you might say \"Oh! Tu viens de Paris? C'est bon. Je viens des Etats-Unis.\" (\"Oh! You're from Paris? That's nice. I'm from the United States.\")\n","Include French fillers when you're looking for the right word.\n","When you speak English, you probably include fillers such as \"so\" and \"uh\" or \"um\" naturally as you're speaking. The French are no different. Using French fillers makes it sound less like you're reciting lines from a textbook and helps you keep your mind thinking in French. Some fillers to use include:[8]Alors. This is the equivalent of saying \"so\" in English, and can be used positively or negatively as you're speaking.Quoi. While it literally means \"what,\" French speakers use this filler the same way you might say \"you know\" or \"you see\" in English. Tu vois? also works the same way as \"you know.\"Euh. This sound is similar to saying \"uh\" or \"um\" in English.Bon. This is similar to saying \"ok,\" and can be used positively or negatively. Eh bien is used similarly, much like you would say \"well\" in English.\n","Read aloud from French books or websites.\n","Reading aloud lets you practice your French without having to worry about coming up with words on your own or following grammar rules. Books and online articles also give you a better sense of how real French people communicate in daily life.[9]You can find French ebooks online for free. Be careful about reading older classics, however, as they won't give you a good sense of how modern French is spoken. French news and pop culture websites and blogs are a good place to start reading in French.\n","Make mistakes with grace and poise.\n","When you first start speaking French, you will make mistakes. Mistakes are a normal part of learning anything new. Accept that you will make mistakes and that native speakers will misunderstand you. Instead of apologizing for your accent, do what you can to make your meaning understood.Remember that everyone has an accent. Think about how charming it is to hear someone speak fluent English with a foreign accent. That's exactly the way you sound to French people.Just as there are multiple English accents among native speakers, there are also multiple French accents. Learning an accent that's closer to your native accent may come easier than simply learning the Parisian French normally taught in textbooks. For example, if you have a southern American accent, you may find the slower Provenal accent easier to pronounce. Finding an accent you feel comfortable in will boost your confidence when learning the language.\n","Sing along with French music.\n","The repetition and rhythm of music make it easy to remember and give you the opportunity to expand your vocabulary in context. You'll also learn more about how native French speakers express themselves.[10]If you can read French, find song lyrics and try to read along. This will improve your reading skills as well as helping you recognize liaisons and silent letters.Don't worry if you don't know the lyrics or completely understand what the words mean  just try to mimic the sounds the singer makes. Over time, more words will reveal themselves to you. In the meantime, you're getting practice making French sounds.For example, Listen to Papaoutai religiously. Keep doing this until you can recite all the lyrics!\n","Stop trying to translate French into your native language.\n","French is its own language, with its own words and expressions  many of which don't translate neatly into English or other languages. To become a natural and confident French speaker, train yourself to think in French first.[11]Attempting to translate French into your native language not only slows down your thought processes, making it more difficult to carry on a conversation, it also limits your vocabulary and comprehension.\n","How to Organize Your Middle School Binder: 13 Steps\n","Sort your papers by class.\n","If your binder or notebooks are full of notes from different classes, in no particular order, start by arranging them into separate piles. Arrange these piles in a row according to the order you attend those classes.\n","Go through each stack and remove old papers.\n","Remove graded work and old assignment instructions, and store them in a separate binder or folder to leave at home and help you study for tests. Set aside classwork from previous years, returned projects, and non-school-related papers. Save any of these that you think will be useful for studying, along with any projects you or your parents want to keep for your own enjoyment. Throw away the rest.Keep the \"at home\" binder or folders in an obvious place where they won't get lost in clutter, such as on a bookshelf in your room.\n","See if you can fit the remaining papers into one binder.\n","Having just one binder for all your classes can be great for keeping yourself organized, since you don't have to keep track of a separate notebook for each class.[1] If you have a giant stack of papers, try to separate them into two binders using one of these systems:Try using one binder for classes before lunch, and one binder for classes after lunch. If you have a locker at your school, you only need to carry one of these around at a time, but remember to pick up both before you leave for the day.If your school has Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes and Tuesday-Thursday classes, separate your papers into two binders so you only need to take one binder to school each day. Remember to put the right binder in your backpack the night before each school day.\n","Insert a colored divider into your binder for each class.\n","Dividers are just a colored sheet of paper, usually with a small tab where you can write the name of a class. Put colored dividers into the binder in the order your classes happen. For instance, if your first class is math and your second is English, put a blue divider labeled \"Math\" at the front of your binder, followed by a red divider labeled \"English.\"\n","Insert a three-hole folder into each class section.\n","Two-pocket folders are a great tool to have, since they let you put in and take out papers without having to open and close the binder rings. Don't use this for all papers. It's best for handouts or homework assignments that are due in the next day or two, since they won't be staying in the binder for long.\n","Use a plastic sleeve to protect important papers.\n","Most classes have a syllabus, assignment list, or other papers that you need to look at throughout the semester. For each class, find a plastic sleeve or \"sheet\" protector with three holes and put it in the binder after the folder for that class. Keep each important paper in a separate sleeve to protect it from tearing.\n","Organize your other papers to see if you need white dividers.\n","Before you put the rest of the papers in your binder, organize the papers from each class from oldest to newest. If you have more than fifteen papers in the stack, use white paper dividers to organize them into categories. These are blank sheets with tabs, just like the colored plastic dividers you already have in there, but the different look should make it obvious that they divide papers within one class, instead of dividing multiple classes. Here are some examples of how you could divide papers from one class into multiple sections:For almost any class, you could use three white paper dividers labeled \"Handouts,\" \"Homework,\" and \"Notes.\"If a teacher gives you tests on specific topics, organize your class material by those topics to make studying easier. For instance, label your English class dividers \"Reading Assignments\" and \"Vocabulary.\"\n","Put in the rest of your papers.\n","Once you've decided how to sort your papers, put each paper after the colored divider for its class, and after the white divider for its category if you are using those. Sort your papers in each section from earliest to latest, to make them easier to find.\n","Add lined paper for taking notes.\n","Put in about ten to twenty sheets of lined paper for each class. You'll almost certainly need more than this during the semester, but you don't need to add it all now. Keeping less paper in your binder makes it easier to find specific notes, and reduces the weight you need to carry around every day.Add graph paper for your math or science classes if your teacher requests it.\n","Organize your binder each night before class.\n","Pick a time each day to go through your backpack and sort your papers and other supplies. Move graded work and old handouts to a folder you keep at home, so you can use them to study later. Check that all your homework assignments are packed into the right folder in your binder.Some people remember to do this more often if they organize their binder right after they get home. Waiting too long can make you unwilling to return to \"school mode.\"\n","Use a planner.\n","A daily planner or portable calendar makes keeping track of assignments much easier, as well as of upcoming quizzes, tests, exams, and project due dates. Many people write down each assignment in the space provided for the day it is due. If you keep forgetting to look ahead at your assignment, however, you can try a different system that keeps all your current assignments in the same place:[2]Each time you are given a new assignment, write it down in your planner in the space for today' date. Write the due date next to the name of the assignment.Each evening after school, look at your planner's entry for yesterday's date. Cross out any assignments you've completed, then re-write the names of all uncompleted assignments in today's date.Instead of a paper calendar or agenda book, you can use an application, such as Google Calendar. Choose whatever works better for you.\n","Keep supplies left at home in a special place.\n","Notebooks, binders, and returned assignments can easily get lost in a pile of clutter when you leave them at home. Prevent this by clearing space on a bookshelf or drawer, and always keep your notebooks in the same place. Put all papers left at home in a special folder for that class, separate from the one in your binder.\n","Color code your other supplies to match your binder.\n","Ideally, you won't need extra notebooks, but some teachers will require you to use them. If they do, make it easy to remember which is which by keeping them color coded. For example, if you keep your math papers after a blue divider in your binder, use a blue notebook and supply case for your math class.[3]\n","3 Ways to Sleep with a Ruptured Disc - wikiHow\n","Sleep on your side to help relieve pain.\n","When you have a herniated disc, sleeping on your side may be the best choice.

Try to go bed only when you are tired.[11]\n","Dont use electronics before bed.\n","The light emitted by phones, computers, and other devices can confuse your body into thinking it is still daytime. This can make it harder to fall asleep at night.

Try to set aside at least 15 minutes per day to practice a relaxation technique. Doing a relaxation technique right before you go to bed may be especially helpful.You may also try taking a warm bath or shower, listening to soothing music, or having a cup of herbal tea to help you relax before bed.\n","Apply ice\n","to sore areas.

Unplug the power cords for any electronics you arent currently using to avoid overloading your homes electrical circuits.[1]You can tell that some items are using power when theyre not technically on because they have a standby light. For instance, things like DVD players might have a little red or orange light on when they are turned off.\n","Pull power cords out from outlets by holding the plug.\n","Dont pull power cables out by yanking on the cord itself. Always go right to the outlet and pull the plug itself straight out of the outlet.[2]If you pull power cords out by yanking on the cable, instead of the plug, they can wear out over time, which can lead to short circuits.\n","Keep electrical cords away from sources of heat and water.\n","Avoid placing power cords and electrical cables next to a heater, fireplace, or other heat source. Keep them off of surfaces where water can accumulate, such as bathroom and kitchen floors and counters.[3]Heat and moisture can both damage electrical wiring and cause short circuits.\n","Use power bars and multi-plug outlet adapters only when its necessary.\n","Never plug more than 1 power bar or multi-plug outlet adapter per electrical outlet. Only use them when you absolutely need to in order to plug in all your electronics, like behind your TV and entertainment center.[4]If you use too many power bars or outlet adapters, its really easy to overload your outlets and cause a short circuit.\n","Repair or replace any appliances that have damaged wiring or power cables.\n","Check your electrical appliances for signs of damaged wiring like tears and fraying. Avoid using any electrical appliances that show signs of wear in their electrical wiring and get them repaired by an appliance technician or get rid of them and buy new appliances.[5]For example, if you see exposed colored wires between the plug and the protective outer cover of a power cord, replace the appliance or get it rewired.\n","Replace outlets with burn marks, sparks, burning smells, and buzzing sounds.\n","These are all signs that your outlets are worn out or faulty and using them may cause a short circuit. Monitor all your outlets and replace them if you see burn marks around them, sparks coming out of them, or if they make a buzzing sound or emit a burnt smell.[6]#*If you arent comfortable replacing an outlet yourself, call a licensed electrician to come replace it for you. They will also be able to inspect the wiring and make sure that the outlet is the only issue.This is more common for older outlets that are at least 15-25 years old. It is not as likely in a newer home.\n","Avoid running power cables underneath carpets and rugs.\n","Its easy to wear out these cords by walking over them repeatedly and you wont notice it since theyre out of sight. Run power cords along walls instead to avoid wearing them out.It might be tempting to hide a power cord underneath a decorative rug, but there are better and safer ways to hide your cables.

Symptoms include pain (sometimes extremely severe and stabbing) in the back, flank, and abdomen, as well as and difficulty and pain during urination.\n","Talk to your doctor.\n","If you suspect you have a kidney ailment, you should seek medical attention. Be sure to describe your symptoms as specifically as possible to your doctor. You can also ask for information about preventing kidney ailments.\n","How to Treat a Hernia at Home: 16 Medically Reviewed Tips\n","Take over-the-counter pain medicine to relieve your hernia pain.\n","Try nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin (Bayer, Excedrin), ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), or naproxen sodium (Aleve) to alleviate some pain and swelling. Follow the recommended dosage on the bottle and dont exceed the daily limit. If you find your pain doesnt get better or if you keep taking more and more medication, speak with your doctor about stronger treatment.[1]If you take a blood thinner, always check with your doctor before using pain medication. They may want you to take something different so it doesnt interfere with the blood thinner.\n","Relieve discomfort from an inguinal or femoral hernia with a truss.\n","A truss is a supportive undergarment that helps keep your hernia in place (its a temporary solution to help relieve pain until you can have surgery). Since inguinal hernias are more common in men, many trusses are designed for male anatomy (but there are unisex trusses and trusses for women, too). Visit your doctor so they can make sure your truss is properly fitted, but if youre in a pinch, just buy one online. Other hernia supports include:[3]Hernia briefs for men and women (undergarments that apply uniform pressure to the abdomen and groin)Abdominal wraps (wraps that apply uniform pressure all around the abdomen, usually to help with umbilical hernias)Most inguinal hernias need surgery to be repaired, but if your hernia is really small and not causing you pain, your doctor may wait and keep an eye on it.\n","Cut out heartburn-causing foods and avoid large meals for hiatal hernias.\n","Enjoy multiple small meals throughout the day instead of 3 larger ones (this will put less pressure on your stomach so youre more comfortable all day long). Cut out caffeine, chocolate, garlic, tomatoes, and other fatty or fried foods that can cause heartburn, too. Try not to lay down after you eat for several hours.[4]Hiatal hernias are the one type of hernia that sometimes dont need surgery (especially when symptoms can be managed through diet and over-the-counter antacids).If your symptoms increase over time, though, surgery may become the best solution.\n","Eat a fiber-rich diet\n","to make bowel movements softer and easier to pass. Straining your muscles can aggravate your hernia, and constipation can make things worse. Add lots of fruits and vegetables to your daily diet, and consider taking a fiber supplement to help things move smoothly.[5]Eat more oatmeal, nuts, beans, popcorn, chia seeds, and whole grainstheyre great high-fiber food choices!Try to eat at least 21-25 grams of fiber per day if youre a woman, or 30-38 grams per day if youre a man.[6]Make sure to stay hydrated and drink plenty of water every day, too.\n","Lose weight\n","to take pressure off of your abdomen. This can be helpful for all types of herniasweight loss allows the abdominal wall to relax, which helps the hernia opening close more easily and prevents future hernias. Modify your diet to include lean proteins and more fruits and vegetables, and try adding in some gentle exercise every day to lose weight.[7]Hernias can be uncomfortable and it may be hard for you to exercise. Try going for short 15-minute walks, or go to the pool and slowly swim laps. Be gentle on yourself so you dont aggravate the hernia more.Some surgeons may also recommend losing weight before surgery to minimize complications and speed up your recovery afterward.\n","Try natural remedies like ginger root or essential oils.\n","While theres no hard evidence that natural fixes are effective at treating hernia pain or inflammation, incorporating a holistic remedy or two into your self-care routine might support tried-and-true treatments. For example, try massaging castor seed oil over your hernia. Supposedly, this helps the skin retain moisture and hold the hernia in a natural, comfortable position.[8]Add ginger root to teas or your favorite meals. Ginger is said to help reduce inflammation, which may make your hernia feel more comfortable.[9]Mix a glass of milk with a pinch of turmeric or a spoonful of licorice herb powder to reduce inflammation.Drink plenty of herbal teas, or try a glass of aloe vera juice before each meal for its soothing, anti-inflammatory effects.Sprinkle extra black pepper on your food to suppress acid reflux and stimulate healing.\n","Lift bulky or heavy objects safely\n","to avoid abdominal muscle strain. Instead of bending over at the waist to pick up heavy items, bend your knees so youre squatting. Bring the object close to you and then straighten your legs and stand up. Keep the heavy object at chest level and try not to twist and turn too much.[10]For heavy items you cant lift yourself, use a dolly. Wedge the bottom of the dolly under the item, then pull the dollys handle to lift the object. From there, wheel it wherever it needs to go.\n","Relax while going to the bathroom so you dont strain your groin area.\n","This is a little counterintuitive, but try to not push super hard when you have a bowel movement. Take your time and let your body slowly work things outit may take longer than usual, but its gentler on your body and can prevent further damage. Go to the bathroom whenever you feel the urge instead of holding it in for long periods.[11]Try putting your feet up on a short stool to make those muscles relax and help you go to the bathroom more easily.Add a hot cup of coffee to your morning routine. The heat and caffeine can help things get moving.Maintain a high-fiber diet to help your bowel movements. Fiber can also help prevent hernias and manage discomfort if you already have one.\n","Strengthen your abdominal muscles\n","to prevent additional hernias. Weak muscles make it easier for your internal organs to break through your abdominal walls. Exercise your core gentlytoo much pressure or exertion could actually cause a hernia, so start slow and stop any exercises that cause you pain.[12]Try doing crunches every day. Lay on your back with your knees bent and put your hands behind your head. Use your ab muscles to lift your shoulders 3 to 4in (76 to 102mm) off the ground before lowering yourself back to the ground. Aim for 3 sets of 10 reps.[13]Swim for low-resistance strength training. The support of the water makes it easier to exercise without straining your abs as much. Start slow if youre new to swimming or doing water exercises, and enjoy your time in the water!Try yoga to gently stretch and tone your core. If youve never done it, consider signing up for a beginners class.\n","Quit smoking\n","to improve lung health and eliminate excessive coughing. There are lots of reasons to stop smoking, and preventing hernias is one of them! Chronic coughing strains your muscles in both your abdomen and groin, which can make an existing hernia worse. Start curbing your smoking habit, or just quit cold turkey.[14]It can be extremely hard to stop smoking. If youre having a hard time, talk to your doctor. They may be able to help make the transition easier.\n","See your doctor for an official diagnosis before treating yourself.\n","You will likely recognize the signs and symptoms of a hernia on your own, especially if its large. However, its easy to misdiagnose yourself, so see your doctor to make sure what you have is a hernia. Your doctor will make a proper diagnosis so you can be sure youre getting the right treatment.[15]Your doctor will do a physical examination to check for a hernia. Theyll look at the area and may press into it with their hands.In some cases, your doctor may do imaging tests to view the hernia like an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.Hernia symptoms include a bulge protruding from your abdomen or groin, a burning or sore feeling at the bulge, and groin or abdominal pain (especially when bending over or lifting).\n","Talk with your childs pediatrician if they develop an umbilical hernia.\n","For infants and children under 5, always check with your pediatrician to see what treatment they recommend. Many times, an infants hernia will close on its own over time. If it hasnt gone away by the time your child is 3-4 years old, they may need a small procedure to have it fixed.[16]Umbilical hernias are common with infants, and they usually dont cause your child any pain or discomfort.\n","Let your doctor know if you have a hernia while youre pregnant.\n","Because of the extra strain on your body, hernias are fairly common among pregnant people. If you |suspect you have a hernia, talk to your doctor so they can check it out. Your doctor will most likely want to wait until after birth and recovery before treating the hernia if you need surgery, but may have to operate if the hernia symptoms are severe.[17]If your doctor decides to wait until after birth, rest assured that the hernia wont endanger you or your pregnancy (they wouldnt decide to wait if there was a severe risk of complications).If you need hernia surgery during pregnancy, it will most likely be scheduled during the second trimester.The severity of your symptoms and the state of your pregnancy determine what treatment your doctor pursues. A laparoscopic surgery with a mesh implant is typical.\n","Visit your doctor ASAP if your hernia turns dark red or purple.\n","This can be a sign that your hernia is strangulated. This means your hernia may be cutting off the blood flow to part of your intestines and could require urgent medical treatment. Go to the doctor quickly because you may need an emergency surgery.[18]Try your best to not worry or panic. Hernia surgeries are common and are often quick and easy to perform.\n","Seek emergency care for pain, nausea, vomiting, or blocked bowels.\n","If your hernia is strangulated (blocking a section of your intestines), your bowel movements will get caught behind the hernia, causing pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloating. You will likely not be able to pass gas or have a bowel movement. See your doctor or go to the emergency room right away if this happens because youll likely need emergency medical treatment.[19]This is a treatable condition, though it can be really scary at the moment. As soon as you suspect a problem, get medical attention so you can get back to normal as soon as possible.\n","Have a surgery to correct your hernia and prevent future ones.\n","These procedures are generally pretty quick and you usually get to go home the same day. The surgeon will make a small incision near the hernia and push it back into place. From there, they will sew and reinforce the tear with a mesh screen or other material so that the hernia will be less likely to protrude again.[20]Make sure to follow all recovery instructions after your surgery. Take it easy, avoid heavy lifting for a while, and take your prescribed pain medication.\n","Easy Ways to Write a Circular Letter: 12 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Decide who your letter should be written to.\n","When writing a circular letter it is important to have a specific audience in mind. Knowing who your audience is from the get-go will help you to craft a clear and effective letter that is customized specifically to them.[2]\n","Write an introductory greeting.\n","Begin with a general salutation, such as \"Dear Investor\" or \"Hello Dear Customer.\" This simple greeting sets the tone for the letter and shows that you are a professional.[3]For a circular letter that is going to many people, you cant use the common personal greeting, such as Dear Jane Smith. Instead, you have to use very general language while still being cordial and engaging.You can try a warm greeting, such as \"Dear Valued Customers,\" or \"Dear Esteemed Colleagues,\" or a just simple greeting, like \"Dear Community Members.\"\n","Give a brief explanation of who you are.\n","This information should include your professional position, if that is pertinent to the letter, and how you are connected to the readers. This gives the reader context about why you are writing to them, and thus tells them why they should keep reading.For example, if you own a catering business and you are writing to previous clients, write, \"My name is Erin Smith and I own Catering Plus. I'm writing to you today because I am grateful to have had you as a customer in the past.\"\n","Tell your readers about your main topic in the first paragraph.\n","When writing a circular letter it's important to let the reader know your point rather quickly. Instead of beating around the bush, tell the reader what you want them to know right away. This will ensure that even if they dont keep reading, they get the general idea.Are you writing to promote a sale? Are you writing to inform people about an investment opportunity? Whatever the main message is, clarify that at the beginning.[4]For example, if you want the reader to buy your product, say something like, \"I am writing today because I have a wonderful new product that I think you might find useful.\"\n","Make a list of your supporting points so you can refer to it as you write.\n","Having additional points or ideas you want to express in the letter written out in a list can help you stay on message as you write the body of the letter. Make bullet points of everything you want to be included in the letter so that you can remember to include them all and cross them off when you have included them.[5]For example, if you are writing about a sale on a product you sell, bullet points you might list include the sale price or discount percentage, how long the sale will be running, and how to contact you to purchase the product.\n","Give supporting information in 1 or 2 core paragraphs.\n","Each of your paragraphs should be focused on supporting your overall point. Tell the reader the details about why they need your product, why they should do what you are asking them to do, or why changes are happening in your company. These need to be short, clear paragraphs that work to prop up the central point of your letter.[6]For example, if your letter is about a sale your business is having, make one paragraph about what exactly is on sale. Begin the paragraph by writing, \"Let me tell you a bit about this product so that you understand what a great deal we are offering.\"Another paragraph could be about why your offer is such a good deal. You could start this paragraph by telling your potential customers, \"We are offering you such a good deal on this product because we value you as a customer and we want to pass our savings on to you.\"If you are writing to your company's employees about the office moving to a new building, the core one or two paragraphs should contain a general timeline for the move and how they should expect the move to impact their workflow. You could start by saying, \"The whole move should take 2 weeks,\" and then go into detail about how that time will be broken down.\n","Write out a concluding paragraph or statement.\n","In your conclusion, you should restate your main point and thank the reader for taking the time to read your letter. This will drive your point home and create a good feeling as the reader finishes reading your letter.[7]For example, if your circular letter is telling readers about your new professional position, repeat your title and why this information might be important for the reader to know. You could say, \"Once again, I am very grateful to now be the head of the marketing division of Omniglobal and I hope that with this new position I will be able to build a new and productive relationship with your company.\"\n","Edit your letter for length.\n","A circular letter should be long enough to give the reader all the pertinent information you want them to know. However, it also needs to be short enough so that the reader doesn't get bored reading it. If the letter is longer than a page, it needs to be shortened. Look for repetition in your writing and edit that out. Also, assess whether your reader needs to know all the details you have provided and take some out if they don't.It can be difficult to edit your own writing, as you thought that everything you included was important enough to include. Because of this, consider asking someone with fresh eyes to look over your work.\n","Read over your letter and fix any typos.\n","Once you finish writing it's important to go over your work to look for mistakes. Taking the time to do this will help ensure that your letter comes across professionally and that the reader can focus on your message, instead of your mistakes.[8]\n","Make sure that you are releasing authorized information.\n","When sending a business letter it's important to give out very limited information. Do not send out confidential information or information that you don't want the general public to know in a circular letter.[9]For example, if you are writing a circular letter that is going out to employees about a change in leadership in your company, in many cases you don't want to include the underlying reasons for the change as they might reflect poorly on the company or they might open the company up to a lawsuit.\n","Format\n","your letter. Your letter should have a business format that includes the name of your business and its address at the top, usually in the center. If you have a business header, that can serve this purpose. You should also include the date at the top left-hand side above the greeting so that readers know if the letter is current when they read it.[10]At the bottom of the letter you should include your name and contact information, which usually includes your email address and phone number.\n","Verify that you are sending your letter to the right people.\n","After you have finished your letter all you need to do is send it out. However, look over your mailing list one more time before you send it just to make sure that it's going out to everyone you want it to and that the addresses you are using are correct.In general, make your mailing list as large as possible if you are getting information out about your business. The more people you reach, the more likely you will get more customers and business connections.\n","How to Apply Testosterone Cream: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Choose your product.\n","Once your doctor has established that youd benefit from testosterone gel, talk with them about what product (and strength) is most appropriate for you. Androgel and Fortesta are both available in individual packets and multi-dose pumps.[1] Vogelxo is available as individual packets, multi-dose pumps and tubes.Prime the applicator before using it for the first time by holding it over a sink and pushing the pump until it releases full doses of gel. If youre using an Androgel of Vogelxo, pump it three times.[2] If youre using Fortesta, pump it 8 times.[3]Wash the extra gel down the drain or prime the pump over a waste bin that pets and children cant access.Individual packets (AndroGel, Fortesta, and Vogelxo) are pre-portioned and dont need any primingyou just tear the packet open.If youre using testosterone for gender-affirming care, talk to your doctor about what results you want from HRT. It can take longer for your secondary sex characteristics to develop with topical testosterone compared to injections.\n","Measure out the correct dose.\n","Once you've primed the applicator, wash your hands and pump the prescribed amount of testosterone gel into your palm.[4] If youre using individual foil packets or the Vogelxo single-unit tube, squeeze the entire contents into the palm of your hand or directly to the area your doctor recommended applying it.[5]AndroGel is available in two dosage strengths: 1% and 1.62% concentrations. Both are applied to the skin, but in different amounts.The recommended starting dose of AndroGel 1% is 50mg (4 pumps) applied once daily to your skin.[6] AndroGel 1.62% prescriptions start at 20.25 mg (1 pump) daily.The strength of the gel and number of pumps you need are based on your base testosterone levels and how large a person you are.\n","Apply the cream/gel to your body.\n","Apply the testosterone cream/gel to clean, dry skin on your shoulders, upper arms, or abdomen (stomach)  unless your doctor recommends a different location.[7] In general, put the gel on areas that can be covered by clothes easily to prevent other people and animals from coming into contact with it.[8]The stronger concentration of AndroGel (1.62%) is usually only applied to the shoulders and upper arms.Fortesta gel/cream is typically applied to the front or inner skin of the thighs (upper legs).Only apply Vogelxo gel/cream to your shoulders or upper armsnot your abdomen or stomach.[9]Never apply Testosterone cream/gel to your genitals or skin that has cuts or scrapes.\n","Wash your hands before and after applying the testosterone.\n","Wash your hands with warm water and soap immediately after applying your cream.[10] Dont touch anything or anyone elsewhile testosterone cream can be beneficial for people who need HRT, it can disrupt the hormone balance in people or animals who dont.If another person accidentally gets the gel on their skin, have them wash the area with soap and water as soon as possible.If you have to have skin contact with someone, like during sex, thoroughly wash the area you applied the gel to beforehand.\n","Cover the application area with clothes.\n","After washing and drying your hands, put on clothes over the area with the gel.[11] Allow the testosterone cream/gel at least 10 minutes to absorb into your skin before putting on your clothesthis is for the protection of other people (and pets) more than anything else.[12]Depending on the health and hydration of your skin, absorption can take less than 10 or up to 20 minutes.Wear breathable cotton garments so your skin can keep absorbing testosterone after your clothes are on.Keep dirty clothes, towels, and bed linens away from pets, children, and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.[13]\n","Wait at least two hours to bathe after applying the gel.\n","After applying AndroGel 1.62%, Fortesta, or Vogelxo, wait at least two hours to shower, swim, or do any vigorous exercise. If youre using AndroGel 1%, wait five hours. Getting your skin wet too soon can wash off the cream.[14]Although the gel/cream may look like it's completely absorbed after 10 minutes, it actually takes longer for it to penetrate all the layers of your skin and reach your bloodstream.\n","Get your testosterone levels checked at regular intervals.\n","Schedule regular visits with your doctor (every few months or so) so they can check your progress, take blood samples, and see if the testosterone medication is working as expected.[15] If your serum testosterone levels are off your doctor can make changes to your dosage.Signs and symptoms that your testosterone levels may be too low include low sex drive, trouble getting an erection, hair loss, lack of energy, loss of muscle mass, increase in body fat, and mood changes (depression).It can take three to six months of daily application of testosterone gel to counteract hypogonadismsometimes longer.Dont use this medicine if youre treating the symptoms of a natural decline in testosterone due to aging.[16]\n","Keep the gel from touching other people and animals.\n","When not prescribed, testosterone can cause a hormonal imbalance and negative health effects. If someone is pregnant, it can cause birth defects in their fetus. It can trigger masculine secondary sex characteristics in women and over-stimulate the sexual development of children.[17]Secondary sex characteristics include a deep voice and increased body hair growth.Rubbing up against the skin of someone who's just applied the gel once or twice isnt especially dangerous, but repeated exposure to testosterone can cause problems in other adults, fetuses, and childrenas well as pets.Have other people avoid touching anything that comes directly in contact with your skin, like clothes, towels, and sheets.\n","Recognize the negative side effects.\n","Applying testosterone cream to your skin for months or years increases the risk of negative side effects. You may experience bloating and swelling, acne, blurred vision, dizziness, flush, headaches, hair loss, sweating, or urinary tract problems.[18]  Let your doctor know about new side effects immediately.If you have a prostate youre more likely to experience blood in your urine, difficulty urinating, or frequent urination.If you have sleep apnea, testosterone cream could worsen your condition. Speak to your doctor about treatment with a CPAP machine.People using testosterone cream are also at risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to the increased red blood cell count that results from testosterone therapy.  Talk to your doctor if you want to be screened for this and keep an eye out for leg/calf pain or shortness of breath.Taking testosterone medication typically causes your testicles to shrink due to atrophy (not working as hard producing natural testosterone). On the other hand, testosterone gel therapy can enlarge the penis or clitoris.\n","3 Ways to Clean the Filter on Your Air Conditioner - wikiHow\n","Determine if you can clean your filter.\n","Some air conditioners have filters that can be cleaned.  But other types of air conditioners have filters that are meant to be disposed of after a given amount of time.  Consult your air conditioners instruction manual to determine whether cleaning your air conditioners filter is an option.[1]If you have a replaceable filter on your air conditioner, replace it at least every 3 months.[2]\n","Turn the air conditioner off.\n","You should never clean your air conditioners filter with the air conditioner on.  This will cause a rush of unfiltered air into your residence and cause your air conditioners evaporator coils and other internal parts to collect dirt and particulate matter.[3]Do not use your air conditioner until youve replaced the filter.\n","Access your filter.\n","On large central air conditioning units, you should be able to locate your filter by looking along the return ducts length.  You might need to unscrew a few screws to access it.  In small window-mounted air conditioning units, youll have to pop the front face of air conditioner off with a putty knife.[4]  In wall-mounted air conditioners, you might have to slide the front panel off in order to access the filter.[5]Consult manufacturer directions for more information on how to access your air conditioners filter.\n","Use a vacuum cleaner for routine cleaning.\n","Just pop the filter out or unclip it (depending on the make and model of your air conditioner) and use the tube extension on your vacuum cleaner to suck all the grit and dust out of the filter.  Replace the filter when youve finished cleaning it.[6]If youve taken good care of your air conditioners filter, you might not see a visible change in the filter when cleaning it.  Rest assured, it is getting clean.On the other hand, you might not be able to get all the dust and grit out of the filter.  Just use the vacuum to suck up as much as you can.[7]This method is best for giving your filter its regular cleaning. However, if you're planning to wash your filter, you should still vacuum it first to remove any large particles.[8]\n","Rinse the filter for a deeper clean.\n","If, after youve vacuumed your filter, it still has a good deal of particulate attached, try washing it.  To get started, remove your air conditioner filter.  Mix one part vinegar and one part water.  For instance, you might mix five cups of water and five cups of vinegar.  Pour the mixture in a tub or a wide sink that can accommodate your filter.Submerge your filter in the mixture for at least one hour.  If it is exceptionally grimy, leave it in for two hours or more.Drain the water and vinegar solution and dry the filter on a rack.  Replace it when dry.Instead of water and vinegar, you could mix a small amount of detergent or liquid dish soap into a volume of water that will cover your filter when it is submerged. You could also soak the filter for about 15 minutes in 1l (34floz) of water mixed with 30g of citric acid.[9]\n","Hose your filter down.\n","If the weather is nice and your filter is too large to fit in your sink, take your filter outside and lean it against a wall.

Knowing your Labs current diet (quantity eaten, treats, human food, supplements) will give your vet a starting point for making necessary dietary changes.[6]\n","Feed your Lab a weight loss food.\n","It may be tempting to simply reduce the quantity of what you already feed your Lab. However, doing this will reduce your Labs nutrient intake, possibly leading to nutrient deficiencies.[7] Instead, feed your Lab a specially-formulated weight loss food. Below is some additional information about weight loss foods:[8]The labels on over-the-counter (OTC) weight loss foods (less active, weight control) are not associated with specific nutritional standards and can be misleading. Therefore, you should purchase a prescription weight loss food through your vet.Prescription weight loss foods tend to contain more protein, vitamins, and minerals than OTC foods, decreasing the risk of nutrient deficiencies.Some weight loss foods are not very calorie-dense, meaning you can continue feeding about the same volume of food to your Lab without increasing its caloric intake.\n","Serve your Lab its meals by itself.\n","Labrador retrievers are known to eat enormous amounts of food.[9] No matter how much you feed a Lab, it will always want more.[10] If you have other pets, feed your Lab by itself so its not tempted to eat another pets food.If you have children, do not feed them when your Lab is around. It may beg for your childrens food, and succeed in getting it. Also, supervise your children if they feed your Lab; they may feed it too much and not realize it.[11]Measure your Labs food with a measuring cup to ensure you're feeding your Lab the right amount of food.\n","Allow your Lab to have some treats.\n","Although your Lab now needs to eat fewer calories, you do not have to cut treats completely out of its diet. Instead, you can feed the occasional healthy treat, such as apple slices, unbuttered popcorn, and bits of bananas.[12] Ask your vet about healthy and appropriate treats before feeding them to your Lab.[13]Be aware that table scraps should not be a treat. They are usually high in sugar and fat.\n","Maintain a consistent feeding regimen.\n","It wont be enough to simply feed the new weight loss food. Keep a consistent meal time and feed the same amount at each meal time.[14] The more consistent you are with feeding the new food, the more likely your obese Lab will lose weight.\n","Address dietary challenges.\n","Your Lab probably wont be as excited as you are about the dietary changes. Below are some common problems and solutions regarding these changes:[15]Begging or looking hungry more often: put the food in a food puzzle toy or distract your Lab with a fun activity (playing, petting)Raiding the trash for more food: give your Lab more toys to play withRefusing the new food: switch to the new food over at least one week (gradually increase the mix of new vs old food); use healthy treats to make the new food look more enticing\n","Monitor your Labs overall condition.\n","Sometimes, a dietary change can affect a dogs appearance and activity level.[16] For example, the diet can change the quality of a dogs coat. If your Labs coat starts looking less healthy (not as shiny), or if your Lab seems more tired, tell your vet about these changes. Your vet may recommend trying a new weight loss food.\n","Talk with your vet about your Labs exercise abilities.\n","Exercise is the other component to treating your Labs obesity.[17] It will help your Lab burn extra calories. Before ramping up your Labs exercise routine, talk with your vet about how much exercise your Lab can handle. To help you come up with an exercise plan, your vet will consider factors like physical limitations (arthritis, injury), other illnesses, and your ability to exercise with your Lab.[18]If exercising with your Lab will be a challenge for you, consider hiring a dog walker or pet sitter that can spend time with your Lab.\n","Start the new exercise regimen slowly.\n","You may be excited about increasing your Lab's exercise, but its important to start gradually. Obesity can make exercise very difficult for dogs, since the extra weight makes moving around a challenge. Instead, start with short, low- to moderate-intensity exercises, like a leisurely walk.[19]To begin the exercise regimen, take your Lab for 5-minute walks a few times a day. When your Lab can handle these walks, gradually increase the time so you can spend 30 to 45 minutes walking with your Lab each day.[20]High-impact exercises, like playing fetch or going for a run, are great for dogs. However, it will probably be better for you to focus on less intense exercises until your Lab reaches its ideal weight.\n","Watch your Labs breathing during exercise.\n","Overweight dogs usually breathe heavily during exercise, since theyre not in very good shape.[21] When you walk with your Lab (or do other exercises), pay attention to how its breathing. If it starts breathing heavily, cut the exercise session short. Allow your Lab to rest and regain its breath.\n","Weigh your Lab regularly.\n","When your vet first determined that your Lab was obese, they likely recommended an ideal weight for it. To assess your Labs weight loss progress, weigh your Lab every two to three weeks.[22] If weighing your Lab at home is not convenient, take it to your vets office for regular weigh ins.A healthy weight loss rate for dogs is one to two percent of body weight per week. If your Lab is not losing weight at that rate, or not losing weight at all, talk with your vet about adjusting your Labs diet or exercise regimen.[23]\n","Maintain the weight loss.\n","When your Lab is no longer obese, pat yourself on the back! Dont celebrate for too long, thoughit will still take work to make sure your Lab doesnt put the weight back on. With your Lab at its ideal weight, maintaining the weight loss will be important.Some dogs can continue eating as they did while on the weight loss program. Other dogs, though, may have to eat less after reaching their ideal weight. This is because their metabolism (rate of burning calories) may have slowed down while losing weight.[24]Continue to exercise with your Lab.\n","Be patient.\n","Successfully treating your Labs obesity will not happen overnight.[25] It may be a number of months before your Lab achieves its ideal weight. Do not lose patience with the process or your Lab, though. The effort to treat your Labs obesity will pay off when your Lab becomes healthy and active again.\n","How to Treat Dog Ear Infections (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Look for symptoms of an ear infection.\n","Pay attention to any unusual behavior changes in your dog and for physical symptoms like:[1]Ear scratchingBrown, yellow or bloody dischargeOdor in the earRednessSwellingCrusted or scabby skin on the near ear flapHair loss around the earWiping the ear area on the floor or furnitureHead shaking or head tiltLoss of balanceUnusual eye movementsWalking in circlesHearing loss\n","Know when to take your dog to the veterinarian.\n","If your dog has any symptoms of ear infection, you should take him to the vet as soon as you can. Ear infections are very painful. Some dogs will let you know they're hurting and may become more aggressive, while others don't show the pain.[2]Either way, it's important to get treatment immediately, since untreated ear infections can damage the ears.[3]\n","Treat the infection.\n","Ear infections are often caused by yeast/fungus, bacteria, or both at the same time. Your veterinarian will probably have you apply a topical antibiotic or give an oral antibiotic to treat a bacterial infection. For a fungal infection, you will likely be instructed to use an anti-fungal ear wash, topical medication, and maybe give an oral anti-fungal medication.[4]\n","Avoid trying to remove anything stuck in your pet's ear.\n","If you know or suspect that a foreign object is stuck in your pet's ear, this may be introducing and causing the ear infection. The ear infection will not go away until the object is removed. Never try to remove the object yourself. Instead, take your dog to the vet.Because the ear canal is L shaped, foreign objects may be deep in the ear, out of plain sight. Specialized instruments and physical or chemical restraint are usually needed to safely remove a foreign body. This is why it's important to let your vet handle it.\n","Determine if your dog has allergies.\n","Allergies are often the primary source of inflammation in the ear, which makes the ears more susceptible to infections.[5] While it may be difficult to determine an allergic cause, it helps to start paying attention to factors such as if new foods or treats were introduced before the ear infection flared up. If they contained a particular protein, you may want to avoid that giving your dog that protein.Animal proteins and dairy products in food are more likely to cause allergies for pets than grains are, despite the popularity of the notion that grain free diets are better for dogs with food allergies.[6]\n","Try putting your dog on a diet trial.\n","Specifically, put your dog on a diet trial with a novel, or new, protein, one your dog has never eaten before. New prescription diets should be fed exclusively for at least 8 weeks and ideally for a minimum of 12 weeks.[7] Give no treats, table scraps or other food sources during this time.This may help to determine if food proteins are the problem and home in on which are culprits. The best novel protein diets are prescription formulas because they will have the least likely chance of cross-contamination with other protein sources, but they are often the most expensive choice.\n","Challenge your dog's diet.\n","At the end of the trial, if your dog is not showing signs of ear inflammation or skin allergies (most commonly itchy paws and sometimes itching of other areas of the body), then you can 'challenge' your dog's diet with a single type of treat or the old food. If you notice signs of irritation near the ears, feet, or skin when you re-introduce the old food or treat, then you know that this food or any food containing this protein should be eliminated.If the ear infections tend to spring up at the same time of year every year, a seasonal environmental allergy may be causing the ear infections.\n","Restrict your dog's activity.\n","While your dog has an ear infection, you should make sure he doesn't get excess moisture in his ears. Avoid letting your dog play in water, swim, bathe, or be groomed until the ear infection has cleared up. Extra moisture will aggravate the ear infection and make it last longer.[8]\n","Follow up with your veterinarian.\n","Keep checking in with the veterinarian until the ear infection is completely gone. Some ear infections are mild and easily treated in 1-2 weeks with topical medications and cleaning. Some infections are more complicated and may take many weeks, further testing, treatments or procedures to treat.Follow your veterinarian's recommendations about when to check in, since the vet can help you determine if the ear infection is cleared or if more needs to be done.\n","Prevent ear infections.\n","Once your dog has had an ear infection, he's more likely to struggle with them throughout his life. The good news is that there are several things you can do to prevent ear infections in your dog. Here are several preventative measures:[9]avoid letting your dog swim or bathe too frequentlyplug your dog's ears with cotton before bathing himflush your dog's ears with a product containing salicylic acid (which helps wet ear canals dry)check and treat any allergies your dog may havefrequently clean your dog's ears\n","Know when to clean your dog's ears.\n","Follow your veterinarian's instructions about how many times per day or week to clean your dog's ears. If your dog has an ear infection, have your vet check his ears to make sure the eardrum has not been damaged or ruptured. Cleaning ears that have a damaged eardrum can make them worse, not better. Cleaning the ears too often cause also harm the ears.[10]Signs of a ruptured eardrum include pain, head tilting toward the affected side and sometimes even rapid jerky eye movements and/or dizziness.\n","Get a cleaning solution.\n","It is best to use a veterinarian recommended dog ear cleaning solution, but many over-the-counter ear flush options are available at your local pet store. These are often effective for routine ear cleaning but don't use them to clean infected ears if they contain alcohol or other harsh ingredients. These can be painful and irritating.If your dog has an infection, your veterinarian may prescribe an ear flush specifically formulated to break up wax, break down bacterial cell walls, and treat yeast causing the infection.\n","Position your dog.\n","Have your dog sit with his back up against a wall or in a corner of a room. This will help you keep him still and prevent him from running away during the ear cleaning. Because ears can be very painful, and because youre working with your pet's face, use a muzzle if you need to or if your pet may be likely to try to bite. It may also help to have a gentle grip over and around the muzzle to hold your pet's head still.Remember that even the sweetest animals can and may bite when they are in pain. It may help to have an extra person around to help hold your dog in place and keep his head still.\n","Apply the cleaning solution.\n","Pour some of the cleaner into your dog's ear canal according to the directions on the bottle. Massage his ear at the base for 20 to 30 seconds to help the cleaner move around and agitate any debris.\n","Plug and massage the ear.\n","Use a cotton ball to plug the ear, then repeat the massaging technique underneath the opening of the ear. This will push the cleaning fluid into the cotton ball to be soaked up. Debris should also stick to the underside of the cotton ball. Be sure to only push the cotton into the vertical canal, until it plugs the opening, but can be easily retrieved.[11]The anatomy of your dog's ear is different from your ear. Dogs have an L-shaped ear canal, containing a vertical canal you can see into, with a nearly 90 degree turn into the horizontal portion of the canal (this is an area you cannot see).\n","Remove and examine the cotton ball.\n","Remove the fluid soaked cotton ball and look at the bottom surface for wax or discharge. Use a cotton ball to wipe the dirt out of the visible, exterior parts of the ear. Gently wipe the inner ear flap and around the ear with a dry, soft towel to clean loose dirt and moisture.[12]If there is a lot of debris on the cotton ball, then repeat the rinse, agitate, and absorb procedure again.\n","How to Deal With an Obsessive Boyfriend: 15 Steps (with Pictures)\n","Choose the right time and place to talk.\n","Talking about relationship problems is never easy. If your boyfriend is becoming obsessive, however, it's important the issue be addressed. Let your boyfriend know you want to talk. Make sure to pick a time and place that will help a conversation run smoothly.[1]If possible, choose a neutral setting. You don't want anyone to feel they have the home team advantage. A quiet coffee shop may be a good place to talk.Choose a time free of outside constraints.\n","Plan what you need to say.\n","Going into the conversation, you should get a sense of what you want to communicate. It may help to jot down your thoughts or talk them over with a friend or family member. Have a few sentences ready to go that best express your frustrations and concerns.[2]Do not over plan, however. Leave some room for flexibility. If you write down everything you want to say word-per-word, you risk sounding scripted.Plan a few sentences that express what you need to express. However, go into the conversation without strict expectations.You can also try practicing what you want to say while looking into a mirror.\n","Make it clear to your boyfriend what behaviors are inappropriate.\n","It's vital to set boundaries when dealing with an obsessive boyfriend. Lay out, with no uncertainty, what behaviors you feel are inappropriate. You boyfriend needs to know where the lines are in the relationship. Behaviors that make you feel unsafe are especially important to address. Make it clear to your boyfriend you will not stay in a relationship where you are habitually made to feel unsafe. Behaviors that make you feel frightened or uncomfortable are not okay in a romantic relationship.Let your partner know that, while you understand he has issues with trust or jealousy, he needs to find appropriate means to express these issues.Figure out what behaviors bother you, and tell him they are no longer acceptable.Keep in mind that obsessive behavior is often present along with other abusive behavior patterns.\n","Use \"I\"-statements.\n","\"I\"-statements are statements phrased in a way that minimizes blame. When you use an \"I\"-statement, you focus primarily on your own feelings, and how a person's behavior affects your feelings. Rather than saying a behavior is objectively right or wrong, you're telling someone how that behavior affects you on a personal and subjective level.[3]An \"I\"-statement has three parts. It begins with \"I feel,\" after which you immediately state your emotion.Then, you explain the behavior that led to that emotion.Lastly, you say why you feel the way you do.Without \"I\"-statements, certain sentiments can sound accusatory.\n","Form a plan to move forward.\n","After the discussion, make plans to move forward. Talk to your boyfriend about how to proceed with the relationship in the future. Work on setting new boundaries that respect both you and your boyfriend's emotional needs. Be willing to compromise in areas that don't violate your needs.For example, you could agree to allow your boyfriend to accompany you to certain social events if it doesn't bother you.Encourage your boyfriend to take steps to be a better partner himself, like asking him to seek the help of a therapist.\n","Consider your boyfriend's concerns.\n","Empathy, or at least some understanding, can help a conversation run smoothly. Think about what your boyfriend may want from you, and what you're willing to give. What expectations does he have that feel like reasonable requests? Where do you need him to meet you halfway? Recognize what you're not willing to give. You should never give in to a request that violates your sense of integrity and security.If something makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, your boyfriend needs to cease that behavior.However, there may be things you can do to help assuage your boyfriend's worries, like checking in more frequently and allowing him to occasionally come with you to events.\n","Learn the signs of emotional abuse.\n","Obsession can be a sign of an emotionally abusive relationship. Emotional abuse can be as damaging as physical abuse. If you are in an emotionally abusive relationship, it's important that you recognize as much and take steps to get out. The following are common signs that a relationship has become abusive:[4]Your boyfriend monitors what you are doing. He needs to know where you are at all times. He may ask to read your texts, email, or messages on social media.Your boyfriend frequently loses his temper, and may yell at you, curse at you, or call you names.Your boyfriend may discourage you from seeing friends or family members. If you take him out with you, he may do things to embarrass you in front of others.He may control how you spend your money.He may threaten to hurt people you care about or your pets.\n","Think about your own emotional needs.\n","If your emotional needs are being violated by a controlling boyfriend, it's important to recognize as much. You should never sacrifice your own sense of fulfillment and happiness for the sake of a relationship. Are you able to feel fulfilled on your own in this relationship?Does your boyfriend allow you to pursue things like a career or a social life?Have you given up anything essential to your own happiness to be with this person?If you feel like your boyfriend's obsessive behavior is making you lose your sense of self, you need to address this.Obsessive boyfriends will push back. Do not be intimidated. Practice firmly saying \"No\" and asserting your own needs.\n","Consider how much contact you have with family and friends.\n","Obsessive boyfriends, particularly those that are emotionally abusive, want their partners all to themselves. If your boyfriend is limiting your contact with others, this is not a healthy relationship.[5]Does your boyfriend not like you to be on the phone or Facebook when he's around?Does he denigrate your personal relationships?Does he try to exert control over who you do and do not see?Your boyfriend may try to make it sound like he has your best interests at heart when trying to limit your contact with others.For example, he may say things like, \"I'm not sure Alyssa is a good friend for you. She's really wild, and I feel like she'll get you in trouble.\"In a loving and healthy relationship, partners support one another's friendships. Your boyfriend should want you to have positive relationships with a variety of people outside your romantic relationship.\n","Look at your boyfriend's personal life outside of you.\n","Your boyfriend may be obsessive because he has little going on outside of the relationship. As you evaluate the relationship, look into your boyfriend's personal life. Is he able to maintain healthy relationships with friends and family members? If not, you may be better off without this person.[6]Your boyfriend may have little going on outside of you. He may rely on you for social contact and support.In a new relationship, it's normal to spend a lot of time together. You may not see your friends as frequently during the first few months of a romantic relationship.However, if your boyfriend expects this intense level of contact longer than a few months, it may be a bad sign.Your boyfriend may try to romanticize this attachment.He may say things like, \"You're my everything\" or \"You're my world.\" While such statements sound sweet and romantic, they are not necessarily healthy or sustainable long-term.\n","Ask your boyfriend about his past.\n","Many obsessive and jealous people have had difficulties with relationships in the past. Your boyfriend may be bringing issues from the past into his present relationship. Ask him if he's been hurt in the past, and if there's anything you can do to help him move forward.[7]Ask your boyfriend what his home life was like growing up. If there was a lot of instability in his household, he may seek stability in a romantic relationship.Ask about past relationships. If your boyfriend was with someone who cheated on him or abandoned him in the past, this may be driving his future obsession.Remember, while your boyfriend's past can help you have more empathy, it does not justify his behavior.Make it clear that, while you understand where he's coming from, he needs to change his behavior.Say something like, \"I get that your father abandoned you as a child, but you need to accept I'm not your father and our relationship is different.\"\n","Take your power back.\n","Once you've evaluated the relationship, and had a frank talk with your boyfriend, you need to take some of your power back. Do not make decisions out of fear of your boyfriend's reaction. Decide what you need to do for yourself and your own sense of fulfillment. Reassert your boundaries when necessary.If your boyfriend gives you a hard time about answering a text in front him, say something like, \"We talked about this. It's important I have my space and you need to respect that.\"Be ready to walk away from the relationship if things don't change. In cases of emotional abuse especially, it's important to get away from the situation.\n","End a relationship that is abusive.\n","If you've concluded the relationship is emotionally abusive, end it. It's very important you not subject yourself to more bad treatment, and it's unlikely an abusive partner will ever change. Periods of normal behavior, in which your partner compromises and treats you well, are cyclical. Eventually, the abuse will occur again and periods of normalcy tend to get shorter as time goes by.[8]Reader Poll: We asked 343 wikiHow readers whove been victims of abuse, and 65% agreed that, in order to maintain safe boundaries after breaking up, it's important to block your exs number and social media accounts. [Take Poll]\n","Find people who value you.\n","If you end an obsessive or abusive relationship, it's normal to suffer feelings of low self worth in the aftermath. A good way to counteract such negative thoughts is through seeking out people who value you as a person. Seek the support of friends and family members who care about you and want to see you successful and happy.Find your most supportive friends. Connect with people who are positive and care about who you are.Have people you can share your passions with. If you're a writer, for example, host a small workshop with your friends where you share one another's work.It's important, in the aftermath of an obsessive relationship to be around people who support you and want you to succeed.\n","Seek the help of a therapist.\n","Whether or not you choose to stay with your boyfriend, it's important you seek the help of a therapist. Individual counseling or couple's counseling can help you sort through relationship issues and learn coping techniques.You can find a therapist through your insurance or you can get a referral from your existing doctor.If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your university.\n","3 Ways to Identify Cutworm Damage - wikiHow\n","Examine your plants in the morning while the damage is fresh.\n","Cutworms tend to be active overnight. If you check on your plants first thing in the morning, youll find it easier to spot the freshly chewed stems.[1]Cutworms especially like young plants, so keep an eye on your seedlings or recent transplants in particular.\n","Look for plants that are cut off at the base.\n","Most species of cutworms feed from the ground, where they mow down plants by chewing through their stems. In some cases, they will attack the roots and cut down the plant below the soil level. Check for toppled plants that have been cut of at or near the bottom.[2]Some species of cutworms will also crawl up into the plant and damage leaves and stems near the top, especially during the summer months.[3]\n","Check for plants that are wilted at the tops.\n","If a cutworm doesnt manage to chew all the way through the bottom of a plant, the top may still wither and die.[4] If you notice a wilted plant, check the base of the stem for cuts or notches.\n","Try to spot bare patches in heavily planted areas.\n","Sometimes cutworms will mow down a large swath of young plants, leaving a bare spot. If you have a densely planted area, such as a field with some type of crop growing in it, look out for bald patches. These may indicate a cutworm infestation.[5]These bare patches are most likely to show up on hilltops and south-facing slopes.If you do see bare patches, closely examine the surrounding plants. Look for plants that are cut off at the stem or have notches chewed into them.\n","Keep an eye out for cutworm droppings.\n","If you notice damage that you suspect was caused by cutworms, inspect the ground surrounding the damaged plants. Look for tiny, pellet-shaped black droppings.[6] You might also spot some of them on the leaves if the cutworms have crawled up higher onto the plant.These droppings can help you distinguish cutworm damage from slug damage. Slug droppings are sludgy, slimy, and S-shaped.[7]\n","Look for caterpillars that curl up into a C shape.\n","There are several species of cutworms, but one of their common characteristics is that they curl up when theyre disturbed. Check for fairly plain, grubby-looking caterpillars that roll up into a C or a tight circle.[8]Cutworms may be brown, grey, black, tan, green, white, or pinkish in color. Some have stripes along their bodies.\n","Search for cutworms in the late afternoon or evening.\n","If you think you have cutworms, the best way to be sure is to find the worms themselves. Cutworms do most of their feeding late in the day or during the night, so you may be able to catch them in action if you check during those times.[10]You may find the cutworms on the ground at the base of the plant or munching on leaves and stems higher up.\n","Run your hand or a trowel over the soil to uncover cutworms.\n","Cutworms like to hide in the dirt or under plant litter when theyre not actively chewing on plants. If you see possible cutworm damage, use your hand or a trowel to turn over the soil and any loose clumps of dirt or debris around the damaged plants. This should help you turn up any cutworms.[11]Check in a 1 foot (30cm) radius around the damaged plant.Cutworms can sometimes hide fairly deep in the soil. The more mature larvae of some species may dig down 34 inches (7.610.2cm) under the dirt.[12]\n","Remove any cutworms you find by hand.\n","In smaller gardens, its not usually necessary to use pesticides to control cutworms. One of the simplest ways to deal with cutworms is to gather up any worms you see and squash them or dump them in a bucket of soapy water.[13]While cutworms arent dangerous to handle, wearing gloves may make this task a little more pleasant.\n","Create a dry soil buffer around your garden to discourage cutworms.\n","Cutworms thrive in moist spoil that is rich in plant material. To discourage cutworms from moving into your garden, surround the planted area with a more dry and uninviting soil material, such as sand or succulent soil.[14]Create a buffer thats about 34 feet (0.911.22m) across around the border of your garden.\n","Keep your garden tidy to remove hiding and egg-laying places.\n","Adult cutworm moths like to lay their eggs in leaf litter and other plant waste, and the young larvae enjoy munching on common garden weeds. You can discourage cutworms from invading your garden by cleaning up areas where eggs and young tend to gather.[15]Clean up leaf litter, grass clippings, and other garden waste.Weed your garden regularly.Avoid fertilizing your garden with green manure, which is attractive to egg-laying adult cutworm moths. Instead, use compost.Till the soil in your garden both at the end of the growing season and before you start planting to destroy any larvae or pupae in the dirt.\n","Protect individual plant stems with cardboard shields.\n","If you dont have a huge number of plants to protect, one effective strategy is to put a collar around the stem of each plant. Take a cardboard tube (such as a toilet paper tube) and place it around the base of the plant with the bottom end pushed about 3 inches (7.6cm) under the soil.[16]You may need to cut a slit along one side of the cardboard tube so you can easily get it around the stem of the plant.Plastic or aluminum foil shields will also work.\n","Attract cutworm predators to your garden.\n","One way to keep cutworms at bay is to invite in animals that eat them. 2 of the major cutworm predators are birds and fireflies, so try some strategies to make your garden friendly to these creatures:[17]Make your garden a firefly paradise by planting low shrubs and trees and cultivating some tall ornamental grasses. They also like bird baths, so put at least one in an area where fireflies like to gather.[18]Attract birds by putting out bird feeders, bird baths, and nest boxes. They also enjoy hanging out in native trees (especially fruit trees), shrubs, and flowering plants, so plant some of those around your garden.[19]\n","Try using pesticides for larger crops or severe infestations.\n","If youre trying to protect a large food crop from a cutworm infestation, you may have to take more drastic measures. Consider using a pesticide such as carbaryl, cyfluthrin, or permethrin.[20]For the best results, apply any pesticides in the late afternoon, when cutworms tend to start becoming active.[21]Be aware that pesticides can also harm beneficial insects, such as butterflies. Only use this approach if you feel you absolutely have to.\n","How to Care for Sea Monkeys: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Use a clean, plastic container.\n","Many sea monkey kits will come with small plastic tanks you can use to hatch and house your sea monkeys. If your kit did not come with a small plastic tank, you can use a clean plastic container that can hold at least two liters of water. Look for a container that has a deep base, as sea monkeys often enjoy swimming around at the base area of their tanks.\n","Fill it with two liters of distilled water.\n","You can use bottled water, distilled water, or any form of unchlorinated water. Avoid using carbonated water or tap water, as it often contains fluoride and other minerals that may not be good for your sea monkeys. Once you fill the tank with the water, you should place the tank indoors so it can warm up to room temperature. This will ensure the water will be warm enough for the sea monkey eggs.You should also aerate the tank water at least once to twice a day with an air pump or a turkey baster.\n","Add the water purifier to the water.\n","The water purifier or salt packet should come in your sea monkey kit when you buy it in stores or online. The water purifier will contain salt, which is important for your sea monkeys as it will allow them to hatch in the water and thrive.Once you put the salt packet in the water, give it a stir and let the water sit in room temperature for another day or up to 36 hours before you add the sea monkeys to the tank.\n","Put the sea monkeys in the water and wait for them to hatch.\n","Once you pour the sea monkeys into the tank, stir the tank water with a clean plastic spoon. The sea monkeys will appear as small dots in the water. But dont worry, they will hatch in around five days and begin swimming around in the tank. Aerate the water while you wait for the sea monkeys to hatch, at least once to twice a day. This will ensure there is enough oxygen in the water for your sea monkeys as they develop and hatch.\n","Start feeding the sea monkeys five days after they hatch.\n","Rather than feed your sea monkeys as soon as they start hatching, you should wait five days. On the fifth day from when your sea monkeys hatch, you can give them sea monkey food. The sea monkey food should come with your sea monkeys as part of a kit. Use the small end of the feeding spoon to sprinkle one small spoonful of food in their tank. You should give them a small spoonful of food every 2 days. Do not give your sea monkeys fish food or foods other than sea monkey food.\n","Give them sea monkey food every five days.\n","You should feed your sea monkeys every five days to keep them healthy and happy. Do not overfeed your sea monkeys as this will often kill them.Sea monkeys are transparent, which means you will be able to see their digestive tract if you look at them closely. When their digestive tract is full of food, they will have a black stripe down the middle of their body. Once they poop out the food, their digestive tract will be clear again.\n","Feed your sea monkeys less food once algae develops in the tank.\n","Over time, green algae will start to appear in the tank. The tank may also smell grassy, like a freshly mowed lawn. These are all good signs, as the green algae actually acts as food for sea monkeys and helps them stay healthy. You can switch to feeding your sea monkeys once a week once green algae begins to form and build up in the tank.[3]You should also not worry about cleaning the tank once the algae starts to develop. The tank may look green and full of algae, but it is actually very healthy and good for your sea monkeys that way.\n","Aerate the tank water twice a day.\n","Your sea monkeys need oxygen to live happily in their tank. If they become oxygen deprived, they may turn a pinkish color and appear slow-moving or tired. To ensure the water has enough oxygen, you should aerate the tank twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. You can use an air pump to aerate the water, such as an air pump used in small aquariums. Stick the air pump in the water and let it aerate the tank for at least one minute, twice a day.Another option is to use a small turkey baster to aerate the tank. You can squeeze the turkey baster in the air and then put it in the water and release the air to put more oxygen in the water. Pull the turkey baster in and out of the water, placing air in the water, for at least one minute, twice a day.To make your own air bubbler: Take a pipette that you aren't planning on using for anything else. Poke a hole in the very top, then poke many tiny holes in the squirting-out end. Either use a pin or staple it several times from different angles with a stapler, then remove the staples.If you do not want to remember to aerate the tank twice a day, you can place a small live plant in the sea monkeys tank to provide oxygen in the water. Use an underwater aquarium plant that is known to provide good oxygen underwater.\n","Place the tank in a warm place.\n","Sea monkeys do best in a spot that's a little over room temperature.[4] You should put their tank in a spot of your house that gets indirect sunlight and is at least 22 Celsius (72 Fahrenheit). This will ensure the tank gets enough heat and is not too cold for your sea monkeys. A tank that is too cold will lead to them becoming immobile sea monkeys and sea monkeys that do not grow. If you notice the sea monkeys are not moving in their tank or growing, it could be because the tank is too cold and needs to be moved to a warmer spot in your home. Place it in a spot with indirect sunlight so it gets enough heat but does not get too hot.\n","Do not change the water unless it smells very foul or appears cloudy.\n","Green algae in the tank is a good thing, as the algae acts as food and provides oxygen for your sea monkeys. But if you notice the tank smells really bad and the water appears dark and cloudy, you may need to clean the tank and the water. You will need a coffee filter and a clean glass filled with unchlorinated saltwater. Use a net to take the sea monkeys out of the tank and place them in the clean glass with water.Place the coffee filter over a clean tank and run the tank water through the coffee filter several times. Try to filter out as much of the gunk in the water as possible.You can use a paper towel to clean out the bottom and sides of the tank. You can also use a Q-tip to clean out any gunk in the crevices of the tank.Smell the tank water to check that it no longer smells foul. Then, put the water back in the tank, followed by the sea monkeys. Top up the tank water with purified, room temperature water. Feed your sea monkeys and aerate the tank several times throughout the day. Then, feed them again five days later, per their usual feeding schedule.\n","Watch for any white spots in the tank and remove them.\n","If you notice white spots, almost like cotton balls, in the tank water, you should try to remove them as soon as possible. They are a type of bacteria that can kill your sea monkeys. Use a small spoon to get them out of the tank and dispose of them. You may want to also put Sea Medic into the tank, which will help to kill any remaining bacteria. If they still appear after one to two days, you should give the tank a thorough cleaning and replace the water. You may lose baby sea monkeys and sea monkey eggs when you dispose of the water, but this may be the only way to kill the bacteria.\n","Use a small flashlight to make the sea monkeys dance and swim around.\n","You can play with your sea monkeys using a small flashlight or a penlight. Move the light against the tank and note how the sea monkeys will chase and follow the light as you move it around. They will also gather by the light if you keep it still against the tank.You can have fun playing with your sea monkeys by drawing shapes and patterns with the light, which they will then swim around and trace in the tank.\n","Note if the sea monkeys are mating.\n","Male sea monkeys have whiskers under their chins and female sea monkeys often appear to be carrying eggs when they swim around. Sea monkeys will mate often so do not be surprised if you see sea monkeys latching onto each other as they swim. This is an indication your sea monkeys are mating and more sea monkeys will soon be on their way.Most sea monkeys live for an average of two years but due to their high mating rates, you will likely have a continuous supply of sea monkeys in the tank as long as you care for the tank and the sea monkeys properly.\n","How to Become a Registered Communications Distribution Designer\n","Work for at least 5 years in information and communications technology (ICT).\n","Your experience does not necessarily have to be consecutive, but it must all be from within the last 10 years.

The best position when you have a stuffy nose is laying on your back with pillows holding your head up to drain the mucus more effectively.[1]This is a good preventative measure if you're prone to getting a stuffy nose at night due to acid reflux, dry air, or allergens around your bed. However, it'll also make breathing easier if you already have a stuffy nose!\n","Acupressure lets you activate pressure points to ease sinus discomfort.\n","Press your left and right index fingers to either side of your nostrils at the base of your nose. Hold your fingers in place for at least 3 minutes, applying firm but gentle pressure. This simple acupressure move will relieve the congestion in your nose and help you feel less stuffed up as you get ready to sleep!If your stuffy nose persists, repeat as needed to release the pressure in your sinuses.\n","Salt water can break up mucus and flush out the virus if you have a cold.\n","Stir  tsp (2,500 mg) of salt into an 8 fluid ounces (240mL) glass of warm water. Then, take a sip of the salt water and gargle it at the back of your throat before spitting it out. Continue gargling as needed to make your stuffy nose feel better!If your throat is sore in addition to the stuffy nose (which is common for people with a cold), a saltwater gargle will relieve the pain and make it easier to swallow.Kids under 6 years old should not try this method.\n","Steam clears out nasal passages, which improves the stuffy nose.\n","Fill a pot with water and boil for a minute or two before removing it from the heat. Cover your head with a towel and position it over the steaming pot, keeping your face at least 12 inches (30cm) away from the water.[2] Close your eyes and slowly breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth, letting the steam clear your sinuses.Gently blow your nose during and after the treatment. You can do this every two hours or as often as your schedule permits.Add a few drops of essential oil to increase the facial steam's effectiveness. Eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree essential oils are all good options.\n","The steam from the shower will thin out the mucus in your nose.\n","If you'd rather bathe than do a facial steam (or have the time to do both), hop in the shower. Set the water to be hot but not scalding, and be sure to close the bathroom door so that the steam gathers. Once the shower has been running for a few minutes, and the room is thoroughly steamed up, take several deep breaths to clear your nose.Alternatively, if you want the water extra hot to create a steamier environment, you can sit outside the shower and breathe as the steam gathers.[3]\n","Water keeps your nasal passages moist, preventing stuffiness.\n","Thick mucus sticks in your nose more easily, making your stuffy nose that much worse! To loosen the mucus (and keep your nose from getting stuffed up before bed), drink plenty of water to stay hydrated all day long. Women should drink at least 11.5 cups (2.7L) per day, while men should aim for 15.5 cups (3.7L) of water daily.[4]Other fluids might make your stuffy nose worse. Avoid caffeine after 2 PM; while caffeine is useful for an energy boost, it can contribute to dehydration too.Avoid drinking alcohol before bed as well. It'll also dehydrate you and worsen your symptoms, so limit yourself to a drink in the afternoon or evening if you plan to consume alcohol.\n","Chicken noodle soup provides valuable nutrients and hydration.\n","Plus, research suggests that some soup ingredients could have a small anti-inflammatory effect.[5] Regardless, the hot steam in chicken noodle soup can soothe your stuffy nose, and the soup itself will help you stay healthy while youre feeling under the weather. Eat a bowl of soup for dinner so that the effects last into the night.\n","Herbal tea can help you sleep, while honey improves cold symptoms.\n","Plus, many teas have anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties that make you feel better when you're sick. Make a cup of herbal tea; teas like chamomile, peppermint, lemon, ginger, and echinacea are all popular choices that'll soothe your throat and break up congestion. Once brewed, add a few drops of honey and stir it in.[6]Whatever herbal tea you choose, check the label to make sure it doesn't contain any caffeine.\n","Food containing the chemical compound capsaicin can ease congestion.\n","Capsaicin is found naturally in chili peppers (which are notoriously hot) and is capable of thinning the mucus in your nose, reducing the stuffiness. Therefore, eating salsa, hot sauce, curry, and other spicy foods that contain capsaicin can give you some welcome relief from your stuffy nose.Keep in mind that spicy food can also make your nose run more since capsaicin stimulates mucus secretion.If you have an upset stomach for any reason, its best to avoid spicy foods until you feel better.Spicy foods are also not advised if youre treating symptoms caused by acid reflux, as they can make the condition worse.\n","Saline solution reduces inflammation and hydrates your nasal passages.\n","Even if it doesn't fix your sinuses completely, saline (salt) spray can help loosen the pressure enough to get you to sleep. Purchase a bottle of saline nasal spray or make saline spray at home using water, salt, and a small spray bottle. Apply 2 squirts of the saline into each of your nostrils 4 to 5 times a day to clear your nose out.[7]Alternatively, use a Neti pot with saline solution to rinse the mucus from your nose. Turn your head to one side and put the tip of the Neti pot against your top nostril, pouring the solution in and waiting for it to flow out of your other nostril.\n","The strips open up your nasal passage and aid breathing during sleep.\n","You can pick up nasal strips at any pharmacy or get them online. They're easy to apply; simply follow the instructions on the package and place a nasal strip over your nose before bed to ease your stuffy nose and reduce snoring.[8]\n","Vapor rub opens up your airways and helps you sleep.\n","Grab an over-the-counter menthol vapor rub and apply it to your chest and neck areas, following the instructions on the package to ensure it's applied properly. Most vapor rubs contain camphor or eucalyptus oil, which can make it easier to breathe while sleeping when combined with menthol.[9]\n","If you have a dust mite allergy, bedding covers can reduce the effects.\n","Pay attention to your symptoms: do you only seem to develop a stuffy nose when climbing into bed? If so, your body might be reacting to the presence of dust (and dust mites). Use a pillow protector and mattress cover to limit your exposure to the mites, which in turn will keep your nose clear and allow you to sleep easily.[10]Wash and change your sheets once per week, too! This will help relieve symptoms from any allergens within your bedding.[11]If you suspect your stuffy nose is caused by an allergy, make an appointment with your doctor to get an allergy test. From there, the doctor can confirm and help treat your allergies.\n","Mint, eucalyptus, sage, lavender, and tea tree oils can ease cold symptoms.\n","Many essential oils are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties which help treat sinus infections and reduce swelling.[12] Choose an aroma you like and use an essential oil diffuser to spread the scent around your bedroom.\n","A humidifier adds water and heat to the air, making it easier to breathe.\n","If you suffer from a stuffy nose due to dry air, get a humidifier and set it up in your bedroom. The water will evaporate during the night and help keep your sinuses damp. Even if you have a stuffy nose from a cold or allergies, dry air makes the congestion worse, so a humidifier can give you some welcome relief![13]If you don't have a humidifier, fill up a large bowl of water and place it near your head for a quick alternative. The water will slowly evaporate and moisturize the air.To ensure that it keeps sending fresh, clean air into your home, make a point to clean the humidifier and filter every few weeks.\n","Air filters eliminate air-borne allergens that can give you a stuffy nose.\n","If you're allergic to pollen, dust, or even perfume in the air, you might get a stuffy nose from breathing it in.[14] Invest in an air filter and run it in your bedroom for the night; it'll reduce the number of allergens in the air and in turn, make your stuffy nose feel better.For maximum effectiveness, pick an air filter with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.\n","Over-the-counter medication can ease your symptoms before bed.\n","Antihistamines will give you relief from sneezing, congestion, and other allergy symptoms if you have allergies. Many antihistamines also cause drowsiness, which is helpful since you need to sleep with your stuffy nose anyway![15] If you have a cold, grab an over-the-counter decongestant to take before bed.Read the medication label before you open it, follow all dosage instructions, and take the medication at the prescribed intervals on the package to ensure your safety. Dont mix different kinds of medication.While antihistamines and decongestants both soothe stuffed sinuses, decongestants are more effective with colds and other illnesses, while antihistamines specifically help against allergic reactions.\n","If your stuffy nose persists or gets worse, it's best to consult a doctor.\n","Monitor your symptoms and call your doctor if your stuffy nose produces a green or yellow discharge and fever or sinus pain, as you might have a sinus infection. Also, contact your doctor if your symptoms last more than 10 days, you see blood in your nasal discharge, or you develop a high fever.[16]Depending on your condition, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics or other treatment. Make sure you describe your symptoms accurately to give the doctor a good idea of your situation.\n","How to Rotate Tires: Rotation Patterns and Pro Tips\n","Front Wheel Drive: Forward cross\n","Move the front tires straight back so theyre in the rear on the same side. Bring the rear left tire up to the front right side of the vehicle. Cross the rear right tire over to the front left side of your vehicle.[1]\n","Rear Wheel Drive: Rearward cross\n","Bring the rear tires straight forward and keep them on the same side of the vehicle where they started.

Then, swap the front right tire with the rear left tire.[3]\n","Directional Tires: Front-to-back\n","Directional tires have treads that are only meant to spin in one direction for better traction. Keep the tires on the same side of your vehicle. Just move the rear tires to the front, and bring the front tires straight back to the rear of your vehicle.[4]\n","Staggered Tires: Side-to-side\n","Staggered tires are when your rear tires are slightly wider than your front tires, which youll find on most high-performance cars. Swap the positions of your front tires so the left tire is on the right side and vice-versa. Then, switch the sides of the rear tires.[5]If you have staggered directional tires, you wont be able to properly rotate your tires unless you remove them from the rim and switch the sides theyre on. If you arent able to remove the tires, then take your vehicle into a mechanic to see if you need to replace them.\n","5-Tire\n","If you have a full-sized spare tire, you can do a 5-tire rotation instead. On a front wheel drive vehicle, move the rear left and rear right tires to the front right and front left respectively. Bring the front left tire straight back to the rear left side. Use your spare tire for the rear right side. Take the front right tire and store it as your spare.[6]If you have a rear wheel drive or all wheel drive vehicle, then move the back right tire to the front right and the rear left tire to the front left. Move the front right tire to the back left. Use your spare tire for the rear right side. Keep the old front left tire as your new spare.\n","Dually pattern\n","For light trucks that have dual rear wheels, bring the front tires to the outside of the rear axle. Move the outer tires on the rear axle to the rear inside position. Finally, take the inner rear tires and bring them straight forward as the new front tires.[7]\n","Loosen the lug nuts with a lug wrench.\n","You can get better leverage when you loosen your lug nuts while your vehicle is still on the ground. Park your vehicle on flat, level ground. Turn each of the lug nuts counter-clockwise until theyre looser and easier to turn.[8]If the place where you parked isnt level, block the tires with wheel chocks to keep your vehicle from rolling.Dont remove the lug nuts completely yet since the tires could slip off your vehicle and cause damage.If you need to remove a stuck tire, try knocking it loose by tapping a piece of scrap wood against the side of the tire with a hammer.\n","Jack your car up onto jack stands.\n","Find the jack points under your vehicle, which are usually reinforced metal parts of the frame just behind or in front of your tires. Place a car jack against the frame and lift up your vehicle. Position the jack stands underneath your vehicle's frame, and lower the jack back down. Use a total of 4 jack stands so you have one next to each tire.[9]Check your vehicles manual to find the proper jack points if you have trouble finding them on your own.Avoid trying to rotate your tires while your vehicle is on the jack since it could easily slip off, which could lead to damage or injury.\n","Remove the lug nuts to take the tires off your vehicle.\n","When you have your vehicle lifted up, use your wrench to finish unscrewing the nuts. Then, just simply pull the tire off your vehicle to remove it.[10]Keep the lug nuts in a small bowl so you dont misplace them.\n","Move the tires to their new locations following the rotation pattern.\n","Use the appropriate tire pattern for the type of vehicle and tires you have. Just roll the tire to the new position, and carefully slide it straight onto the bolts in the new wheel well.[11]When in doubt, check your vehicles manual for the proper tire rotation pattern to use.\n","Screw the lug nuts in until they feel snug.\n","Feed the lug nuts back onto the ends of the bolts and turn them clockwise to tighten them. Turn them as far as you can by hand before using your lug wrench to turn them until they just feel snug.[12]Dont screw the nuts in completely just yet since you could over-tighten them by accident.\n","Lower your vehicle back to the ground.\n","Slide your jack back underneath your vehicle so it presses against the frame. Lift your vehicle up slightly so you can slide out the jack stands. Then, slowly lower your vehicle back onto the ground.[13]\n","Finish tightening the lug nuts in a star pattern with a torque wrench.\n","A torque wrench prevents you from over-tightening the nuts and damaging your tires. Adjust your wrench to the proper torque, and turn one of the lug nuts until you hear the wrench click. Find the nut directly across from the first one and tighten it. Then, tighten the nut thats right next to the first one. Keep working back and forth between the lug nuts until theyre all tight.[14]Each vehicle has different torque requirements, so check the manual to know what you need.\n","Even tread wear\n","If you keep your tires in the same spot the entire time, the backs of the treads will wear away faster than the fronts, which could make them uneven. When you change the tire positions, the wear and tear occur on the opposite sides of the tires so the treads maintain a consistent depth.[15]Rotate your tires every 5,0008,000 miles (8,00012,900km) to prevent uneven wear.\n","Extended tire lifetime\n","The tires that you use to steer your vehicle tend to wear out quicker than the others since theyre turning and support more weight.

Make sure there's enough water to completely submerge the broccoli. Then, leave the broccoli in the water undisturbed to soak off dirt and debris.[1]When you first put the broccoli in the water, swirl it around in the water a few times to loosen any larger pieces of dirt.If you use warm water, the florets of the broccoli can wilt slightly.If you dont have a sink available, you can use a large bowl instead. Just make sure the broccoli is submerged under the water.\n","Place the broccoli in a colander and run it under cold water.\n","After soaking the broccoli, drain the sink and turn on the cold water.

You can use this side of the cuticle pusher to scrape away any debris or dirt that is near the cuticle.[4]Be careful with this tool. Do not try to stick it under the cuticle.\n","Squeeze excess skin with the cuticle nippers.\n","After you finish pushing back and cleaning around the cuticle, check for any excess skin around the cuticle area that might interfere with painting the nail. If you spot any excess skin, then you can use the cuticle nippers to remove it.[5]To use the cuticle nippers, open the nippers and place them over the excess skin. Look for skin that is sticking out or that appears ragged.Then, squeeze the nippers to sever the skin from the cuticle and then release. Do not squeeze the skin and pull! This may result in bleeding.After you release the nippers, the skin you squeezed should come right off or you should be able to brush the skin away.\n","Trim nails with a straight edge clipper.\n","If the nails are much longer than you want them to be, then you will first need to use a straight edged nail clipper to bring down the length.[6] A straight-edged nail clipper will result in some square edges, but it will also allow you to be more accurate.Clip only a small amount of the nail at a time. Otherwise, you may end up trimming too much.\n","File your nails.\n","Next, you will need to file down any rough edges left on the nail. Use a nail file to smooth out ridges and to start to shape the nail.[7] There are some important things to keep in mind when you file nails. Make sure that you:Start with a fine nail file. Nail files have grits like sandpaper, so choosing a nail file with a high number grit will mean that it is finer. A lower number grit nail file will have a coarser edge. It is best to start with a high grit or fine nail file to avoid tearing or damaging your nails.File your nails in one motion. Do not use a sawing motion to file your nails. Instead, place the file against one edge of the nail, move it in a swift forward motion, and then remove it from the nail and start over.Hold the edge of the nail file flat against the edge of your nail. If you angle the file, then this can thin out the nails tip and weaken it.\n","Buff nails for a smooth finish.\n","After you are done filing, use a nail buffer to smooth out the tops of the nails. This will improve the texture of the nails and make it easier to apply and even coat of nail polish.Use a back and forth motion to buff your nails.Some nail buffers also include a shine edge that you can use to give nails a natural shine after you finish buffing them.Buffing your nails is a good nail care practice as long as you do not do it too often. Buff your nails no more than once per week.[8]\n","Dispose of items that are not reusable.\n","Some items cannot be cleaned, so you will have to dispose of these after you use them. For example, emery board cannot be properly disinfected because the material is too porous. Throw these items away along with:[9]Wooden cuticle pushers.Cotton balls and swabs.Paper towels.Toe separators.\n","Clean your tools.\n","To clean your manicure tools, you can wash them with warm water and some liquid detergent, such as dish soap. Use a brush to scrub away any debris from the last manicure. Then, rinse the tools well and dry them off with a clean, dry towel.[10]Make sure that you use a brush that is clean and has been disinfected.Wash your tools after every manicure.\n","Disinfect your instruments.\n","After you have washed your tools to remove the debris, you will also need to disinfect them. This often requires soaking the tools in a disinfectant solution. When disinfecting your tools, always keep in mind that:[11]Spraying your tools is not enough. It is important to immerse tools in disinfectant so that they are fully covered.Ultraviolet cabinets are not a suitable replacement for disinfectant. They may be used for storage, but only after items have been properly cleaned and disinfected.You need to mix disinfectant fresh every day. Disinfectant solution cannot be reused day after day.\n","3 Ways to Save a Fading Newborn Puppy - wikiHow\n","Monitor the litter closely.\n","Look for abnormalities like pups without suckling instincts, excessive crying, and physical deformities such as flattened chests or any absent body parts. Seek emergency care as soon as possible if you suspect somethings not right. Be ready to report your observations to the vet. Take an initial weight of each pup after birth. Continue to weigh them a couple times per day afterward. Within 24 hours, a pups weight might decrease by less than 10%, but should increase steadily after the first day.Take the pups and mothers temperatures at least a couple times per day. Normal rectal temperatures for puppies are from 95 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 37.2 degrees Celsius) during the first week of life, and 97 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (36.1 to 37.8 degrees Celsius) during the second and third weeks of life. Adult dogs and puppies older than four weeks have temperatures that run about 100 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 to 38.9 degrees Celsius).[1]Be ready to describe the mothers diet to the vet. Pregnant and nursing dogs require special diets, which should include a high quality food that consists of 29% protein, 17% fat, and less than 5% fiber.[2]Closely monitor nursing and make sure nursing begins within a maximum of 12 hours of birth. This is because the mother dog will produce colostruma nutrient rich breast milkduring this time, which can promote good health in her puppies. Note if the mother disregards or is disinterested in nursing or attending to the pups.Be ready to describe any interactions your pregnant dog had with other animals in the weeks prior to delivery. This will help the vet diagnose any communicable diseases that might be affecting the pups, such as bacterial or viral infections. The mother may also pass intestinal parasites onto her dogs.\n","Call the vet if any pups separate from the litter or cry excessively.\n","Newborn pups should do little more than nurse and sleep, and should cry only very little, if at all. They should huddle with the other pups without crawling away from the group. If pups deviate from any of these normal behaviors, call the vet immediately.\n","Prepare the whelp box for transport.\n","The vet will most likely have you bring the mother and full litter in for examination. Use the whelp box to transport the mother and pups.Its a good idea to create a whelp box instead of just designating a whelp area for your dog to deliver its litter. That way, youll be able to transport the mother and litter more easily in the event that emergency care is needed.You can use a shallow cardboard box that has a shelf or separate area in it where the puppies can go while the mother is sleeping (to prevent her from rolling over onto them in her sleep).Line the box with several sheets of newspaper or puppy pads before she delivers the puppies, and then switch to a thinner lining, such as an old bedsheet after she delivers.[3]\n","Have the mother tested for malnutrition and infection.\n","The vet will screen the mothers blood for low iron and protein content and ask you about her diet. Theyll also check for birth defects and test for viral and bacterial infections, such as E. coli and parvovirus.[4]These steps will help the vet determine whether antibiotics should be administered.\n","Separate the fading pup from the litter.\n","If any pups do show signs of fading or cry excessively, you should separate them from the litter and call the vet for help. Depending on the symptoms you report, the vet will instruct you to bring the fading pup in for emergency care or advise you attempt alternative feeding methods.[5]\n","Place the fading pup in a separate box.\n","After removing any fading pups from the litter, place them in a separate whelp box. Line the boxs floor with a bath mat or newspaper.Go with newspaper if the pup is emitting discharges or if soiling is a concern. Youll be able to quickly swap out dirty paper for a clean replacement.\n","Keep the fading pup warm.\n","Use a heating pad to warm the separate container. Be sure to check the pad and box frequently with the back of your hand to make sure they arent hot to the touch. Keep a newborn pups temperature within 95 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit (34.4 to 37.2 degrees Celsius).Place the heating pad under the boxs floor lining, or if youre using a wood box, you can place the heat under the box to let the wood conduct heat. However, make sure that the heating pad does not cover the entire area. The puppies should be able to crawl off of the heating pad if they get too warm.\n","Check the pups for dehydration.\n","Gently pull back the skin between pups shoulders. It should snap back into place quickly. If it doesnt spring back into place promptly, the puppy is likely dehydrated.[6]Under the vets advisement, you can try using a clean eyedropper to rub a bit of corn syrup on the puppies gums and then use an eyedropper to give him some water. You can also use puppy milk replacer.\n","Warm the pups gradually if theyre too chilled to nurse.\n","Chilled pups are unable to suckle and digest food, but warming them too quickly can be dangerous. The best way to carefully and gradually warm a chilled pup is to hold it against a large patch of your skin. That way, your body will transfer to the pup without overheating it.[7]If pups are too cold, they wont be able to suckle or digest food, which will cause fading. Pups under a week that are too warm arent yet able to pant to reduce their body temperature.\n","Give the pup a sugar or honey solution.\n","If any pups are dehydrated or if you havent observed them nursing, call the vet and ask if you should administer honey, corn syrup, or a sugar-water solution. If the vet approves, put on surgical gloves and administer a drop of the syrup onto the pups gums every few hours. Avoid alternative feeding without the vets approval.[8]\n","Feed the pup colostrum.\n","During the first one to two days of delivery, the mother produces a special milk called colostrum. By feeding on this fluid within 12 hours of birth, the pups ingest needed antibodies from the mothers bloodstream. Without prompt nursing, the pups will be susceptible to infection in addition to dehydration and malnutrition.If you dont have supplemental colostrum on hand, you can attempt to express it from the mothers teat into an eyedropper and manually feed a pup that hasnt suckled. Your vet can also attempt this process, might have a supply of colostrum on hand, or can supply any fading pups with blood plasma from a healthy dog.\n","Inject subcutaneous fluids.\n","Under the vets advisement, use a sterile drawing syringe to inject a Ringers lactate solution subcutaneously, or beneath the skin. Be sure the solution is warm, and never inject cold solution. Avoid touching the tip of the syringe or otherwise contaminating it.[9]Have your vet recommend an amount suitable for the pup.\n","3 Ways to Know Which Fish to Put Together in a Tank - wikiHow\n","Allow for plenty of space.\n","It is important that you avoid overstocking your tank. The general rule is that you should have room for one gallon of water for each inch of fish in your tank. So, a ten-gallon tank can safely accommodate ten one-inch-long fish. This is a very important rule to keep in mind if you are looking to care for schools of fish.Overstocking your tank can lead to a build-up of toxic waste products. It will also necessitate additional cleanings.[1]Some larger species, such as full-grown goldfish, will require additional tank space. Fish that move around a great deal may also need extra room.\n","Go with either cold water or warm water fish.\n","You need to choose fish that all thrive at right around the same temperature. You can accommodate only a few degrees difference in preferred temperatures or your fish will suffer. A tropical fish generally cannot live comfortably alongside a cold water fish. Your tank equipment needs will also differ greatly as some fish require heaters and lights and others do not.For example, a white cloud minnow is a type of cold water fish that requires consistent temperatures between 72-82 degrees Fahrenheit (22-28 degrees Celsius) in order to thrive. Discus, on the other hand, need a warmer tank that stays in the low to mid 80s Fahrenheit (high 20s Celsius).If your tank is the wrong temperature, your fish may become more susceptible to disease. They may also move more slowly and refuse to eat.\n","Choose fish with similar pH level requirements.\n","Make sure that the fish that you buy fall into the same range on the pH spectrum. Many fish that you buy directly from the store are acclimated to a neutral pH, but will do even better in a pH customized to them. For example, a tropical African cichlid does best in alkaline water. Most freshwater fish prefer a pH somewhere between 6.5 and 7.5.Dont forget to take into account the pH needs of any live plants that you will add into your tank as well. For example, many fresh water plants require a pH between 6.0 and 7.5, a fairly wide range that can overlap with the needs of a number of fish.[2]\n","Go with either freshwater or saltwater fish.\n","The tank filtration needs between these two fish groups are generally different, with tropical fish requiring less in the way of filtration and cleaning. The temperature and pH requirements between them are also dissimilar, which really cant be worked around, even by a skilled aquarist.For example, a goldfish would not live well alongside a cichlid. The goldfish requires colder temperatures and freshwater. In contrast, the cichlid thrives in warmer temperatures and needs hard or brackish water conditions.\n","Provide plenty of hiding spots.\n","Even if you are pretty sure that the fish will get along, it is a good idea to create an interesting tank environment that can provide some alone space for an individual fish. Some fish are generally social and friendly, but also need to get away every now and then. This will also minimize any stress associated with overcrowding.[3]For example, gouramis are fish that love to hide. They establish a dominance system and, during these contests, the weaker fish will often hide from the stronger one.\n","Select colorful, active fish for an eye-catching tank.\n","Some fishes, like the goldfish, will provide a great deal of color and activity. Other fish, such as the shark fish, are less colorful but demonstrate very interesting schooling behaviors. Some fish are bottom-feeders and prefer to hide-out during the daytime, such as the kuhli loach, making them almost impossible to spot.\n","Take your experience level into account.\n","Make sure to consider how comfortable you are caring for fish. If this is your first tank, you may want to go with a relatively simply combination of just one or two low-maintenance types of fish. Single-species tanks are especially good for fish that prefer to swim in schools.Oscars are dominant, large fish that dont generally tolerate other species tank mates well. They will try to eat smaller fish especially. Puffer fishes are good options for experienced aquarists, but they also prefer to be around their own species. Platies and GloFish, for example, are great beginner fish that enjoy living in community tanks.\n","Choose fish with similar eating patterns.\n","Some fish will eat anything and everything in sight, including other fish. Some fish are more picky eaters that will refuse to eat if bullied by others. Some fish require a certain number of pellets, whereas others just need a pinch of flakes. Get to know what the nutritional requirements are for your fish.Make sure to consider the algae needs of your fish as well. Some fish, like plecos, are friendly algae eaters unless that food is not available. Then, they can turn more aggressive.[4]\n","Stock your tank with similar size fish.\n","General wisdom suggests that big fish will usually bully and eat little fish. Try to pair fish together that can grow alongside one another to a similar size at maturity. Angelfish, for example, are known to stalk and kill smaller fish in their tanks. A medium size fish or a schooling fish can sometimes withstand the pressures from larger fish.[5]\n","Choose fish with similar paces of movement.\n","You dont want to look into your tank and see fast-moving fish chasing fish that move a bit more slowly. Learn about how much movement a certain fish species prefers. Try not to pair an overly athletic fish with aggressive tendencies with a fish that is smaller, slower, and more docile.[6]\n","Get a school of fish.\n","Some fish just do better when living and playing in groups. Tropical fish, unlike their freshwater counterparts, seem to particularly prefer living in schools. Try to establish a school of at least five fish, but be aware that you may need to boost your numbers even more. Tiger barbs, for example, are known to develop a temper unless they are placed with an extremely large school of 20 to 50 fish.\n","Buy fish that are not predatory based on sex.\n","Try to find out if the fish that you are interested in do best with those of the same sex or the opposite. This especially important information to consider with regard to spawning behaviors. For example, a male Betta fish really needs to be the only male in residence in a tank. Whereas, a female Betta does fine with other females.\n","Look out for signs of fish stress.\n","Fish will show that they are not doing well through their behaviors and physical appearance. They may start to look overly pale, losing their usual markings. They may start to show signs of injury, such as damaged fins. They may also refuse to eat or leave a hide-out space.Stressed fish are also more likely to become ill. For example, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (also known as white spot disease, ich, or ick) is a potentially fatal infection that is caused by a parasite present in most freshwater aquariums. Stressed fish have a harder time defending themselves from the parasite, which attaches to the fish and feeds on its skin. The first symptom of this condition is usually white spots on the fishs body, followed by irritation, respiratory distress, and then death.\n","Pay particular attention during fish spawning periods.\n","When your fish begin to spawn, this is a time of high stress for all of their tank mates. Fish will pair up and can injure themselves in the mating process. Fish will also be left out from pairings and can behave aggressively as a result. It is often a good idea to move mating pairs into another tank.Also, be aware of what will happen to the offspring created. Livebearers may create babies that other fish in the tank will try to eat, if adequate hiding spaces are not provided.\n","Recognize the unique challenges presented by bully species.\n","Fish keepers have labeled certain species aggressive or semi-aggressive because those types have a tendency to exhibit bullying behaviors in community tanks. If you choose to buy a known bully species, such as a red-tailed shark or cichlid, youll need to keep an extra close eye on your tank.[7]You may also need to remove the bully fish and place it in an alternative tank. So, have an extra tank and materials on-hand.\n","3 Ways to Get a Motorcycle Loan With Bad Credit - wikiHow\n","Talk with your dealer.\n","Not all dealers are as accommodating to low or poor credit scores. You will need to find a dealer that is willing to work with your credit to get you the loan that you want.  Some dealers specialize in this and have unique relationships with lenders that are ready to work with you.[1][2]You will need to speak with the dealer's finance team or department directly to learn if they can help you.Inform them clearly of your situation. You won't get an accurate picture of how likely you are to be financed if you don't convey your exact credit situation to your dealers finance team.You may not need to submit an application for financing to learn if you will get the loan or not.  A capable finance manager should be able to tell you how likely you are to receive the loan when you do actually apply.\n","Find the right lender.\n","It may be tempting to apply wherever you can in an attempt to successfully get your application accepted. However, applying to many lenders at once can actually hurt your credit score further. You should also know that not all lenders are ideal for a motorcycle loan.[3]Apply only to lenders that specialize in personal loans[4] or in motorcycle loans.Look for key terms such as bad credit, poor credit, no credit, motorcycle financing, or after bankruptcy loans. Remember, though, that bankruptcy will typically not be a factor if it has been discharged for two or more years.Loans made to people with bad credit may have higher interest rates. Be fully aware of the conditions of your loan before accepting.\n","Inform your lender if you have a co-signer.\n","A co-signer to a loan is another person that promises to take on payments if you are unable. If your co-signer has a better credit score than you, this can help you to obtain the loan you are seeking.[5][6]Your co-signer should have excellent credit.Having a co-signer helps assure your lender that they are more likely to receive their payments.\n","Demonstrate your payments on a previous motorcycle.\n","If you have made payments on another motorcycle, you can demonstrate your consistency on those payments. Despite your low credit score, by showing your previous motorcycle payments were always met on time, you increase the likelihood that you will receive the loan.[7]\n","Make a larger down payment.\n","Try to save up as much money as you can, without a loan, for a down payment. By placing a larger amount of money down on your motorcycle upfront, you show that you are serious about this investment. Lenders will view larger down payments in your favor.By paying off a majority of the cost, you will also save money on interest when you do take out a loan.\n","Meet the basic requirements.\n","Regardless of how good or bad your current credit score is, you will need to meet some basic requirements first. The requirements help the lender to gauge your capability to repay the loan.Must have valid forms of identification, such as a driver or motorcycle license, and a social security number.Must be at least eighteen years old.You should be earning enough discretionary income to pay the payments. Demonstrating you earn enough to cover the monthly payment will increase your chances of getting the loan.Have held stable employment for at least six months. Having a stable source of income will show that your payments are more likely to be on time and the proper amount.If you are self-employed, you may need to be able to prove that you have worked in your industry for at least two years, and provide a profit and loss statement or a gross earnings statement for the past year.\n","Communicate with your lender.\n","It may seem like having a bad credit score leaves most of the application process up to luck, but a little communication goes a long way. Discuss some of the following points with your lender:[8]If you had a one time reason for your poor credit, such as a medical emergency, explain this and assure your lender that this expense was unavoidable and is in the past.Prove your level of income. Showing exactly how much you earn isn't always required, however, doing so will show that you are serious and capable of paying your loan. Bring in the last two years tax returns or your last six pay stubs to share.Let them know how stable you are. If you have lived and worked in the same place for a period of a few years, let your lender know this. Stability indicates that you are more likely to fully pay back the loan on time.Explain any filing for bankruptcy. If you did file for bankruptcy you should explain why, especially if it was due to a major life event such as a medical bill.\n","Take actions to protect your lender.\n","Showing that you are willing to work to protect your lender's investment will go a long way in their consideration of your application. Demonstrate that you are willing to work with them by informing them of the following actions you should take:[9]Allow them to automatically take payments from your account. This shows that you are confident that the funds will be there as well as assuring them that you will not miss a payment.Inform them that you will be purchasing full coverage insurance, extended warranty, and a GAP policy.Full coverage insurance and GAP policies will help protect the value of your motorcycle in case of an accident or theft.Having an extended warranty will help protect the value of the motorcycle by replacing and repairing parts covered by that warranty, should they fail.\n","Check for errors.\n","The people that work to calculate your credit score can make mistakes.  These mistakes may cause your score to appear much lower than it actually is. Check your credit score and dispute any errors that you may suspect.There are a few online services that let you dispute any errors you may have found such as Experian, Trans Union, or Equifax. If you find disputes with one, check all three to make sure they are fully addressed.Fixing errors in your credit score will increase the score and give you an accurate picture of where your credit is currently.\n","Try negotiating.\n","Despite having missed a few payments, or made a few late payments, you may still be able to negotiate with your creditors to have these events changed in order to improve your credit score. Try asking about the following when negotiating your delinquent or late payments:[10][11]Ask your creditors if you can pay off the full amount on a delinquent loan in order to have it labeled paid as agreed instead of a missed payment.If you have only one or two missed payments on an otherwise great payment schedule, write a letter to your creditor that highlights your overall positive payments. They may remove the late payments affecting your score negatively.\n","Use your credit cards effectively\n",". Credit card use is a great way to positively increase your credit score, so long as you use them properly. Try taking the following steps to increase your credit score by best managing your credit cards.[12] [13]If you do not have a credit card, obtain one and start using it. Sometimes you can get a prepaid credit card if you do not qualify for a regular credit card. These will often charge higher interest rates along with additional fees.Keep the amount charged on your credit card low. Having charges that are maxed out, or close to it, will hurt your credit score.Don't overuse your credit card. Using 30% of your card's maximum limit a month is acceptable, so take the card limit and divide it by three to get the amount you can spend per month. Try to pay off that balance in full every month. Using your card too much in a month, even if you pay it off, will only give the impression that you are a reckless spender.Increase your limit. If you do use your card often, increase the maximum limit. You must be careful to not also increase your spending amount. Strive for ten to thirty percent of your card's limit a month.Don't close any cards. Closing a card will look bad to any credit scoring system. Instead, keep your card working for you by using it to pay for a small monthly bill which is easily repaid.\n","How to Sue a Homeowners Association (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Read the governing documents.\n","Your homeowners association (HOA) is governed by a set of documents. These are typically called your Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs).[2] You should take out your copy and read them.You can sue to enforce any covenant in the CC&Rs. A covenant is a promise made by the HOA to do something. There are probably many covenants in your governing documents. For example, your HOA might agree to mow the lawn once every two weeks or to maintain the exercise equipment in the gym.Read your governing documents closely. If no agreement says the HOA must do something, then it will be difficult to argue that they have violated their agreement.Some CC&Rs may include an arbitration provision. If it does, you may not be able to sue the HOA in court. Instead, you may have to take them to binding arbitration.\n","Meet with an attorney.\n","You should meet with a lawyer before filing the lawsuit. An experienced attorney can advise you about your rights. For example, many states have laws specifically related to HOAs. The lawyer can tell you about these rights so that you can bring your strongest case possible.It is important that you find an attorney with experience suing HOAs. CC&Rs can be very confusing and complicated and you do not want to pay an attorney to learn a new area of the law.To find a lawyer, you can contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral.You should also ask other people who live in your HOA if they have ever sued the HOA and whether they would recommend their lawyer.Always ask the attorney you speak with about their expertise in this particular area of the law. Ask how many years they have been practicing, how many cases they have tried, and what their success rate is. In addition, ask specific questions about your case and gauge their knowledge based on how they answer. They should not waiver or be unsure of themselves. They should be able to give you concrete information regarding your case.You might not have the money to hire a lawyer. However, you can still meet with an attorney for a half-hour consultation. During the consultation, you can ask the lawyer questions which will better prepare you to represent yourself.\n","Ask to see the HOAs books.\n","You should be able to inspect the financial records for the HOA. You should look to see how money is being spent and whether the HOA maintains proper records of how it spends money.The HOA has a fiduciary duty to its members. This means the HOA must fulfill its obligations under the CC&Rs using ordinary care and in a good faith and reasonable manner.[3]If your HOA is careless with the dues it collects, then it is probably violating its fiduciary duty.\n","Judge the seriousness of any physical injury.\n","You might have been physically injured in the common areas. For example, you could have slipped in an icy parking lot or fallen in the common break room. The HOA has a duty to act in a reasonably prudent manner when maintaining common areas.[4] The HOA is \"negligent\" when it fails to act in this prudent manner.It also owes this duty of reasonable care to visitors. If you are visiting a friend or relative and are injured in a common area, then you can sue if the HOA was negligent in how it maintained those areas.If you had to see a doctor for an injury, then it is usually worth suing. However, if the HOAs negligence did not result in any injury, then you might not want to sue.\n","Consider the costs of a lawsuit.\n","Lawsuits can be expensive and time-consuming.[5] You certainly have the right to sue the HOA for not fulfilling its obligations. Nevertheless, you should weigh the seriousness of the violation against the time and money necessary to properly sue the HOA.Be aware that most CC&Rs include fee shifting agreements, which require the losing party to pay the legal fees of the successful party. Therefore, if you are confident about the strength of your case, you may have a good chance at having your legal fees covered by the HOA. However, if you lose, you may quickly double or triple your costs. Suing an HOA can be an incredibly risky tactic and should only be undertaken if you have no other options.You can reduce costs by suing as a group. For example, you can get four other members of the association to join you as plaintiffs. This way, you can split the costs of a lawyer five different ways.In some states, you can also sue in small claims court. Small claims court is designed so that you do not need a lawyer. Also, many small claims courts hold non-traditional hours in the evening or on weekends, so bringing a lawsuit might be more convenient.\n","Decide who to sue.\n","You can sue either the entire HOA board or an individual member.[6] You might not know who to sue because you cant identify which individual board member is responsible for the problem you want to sue over.For example, if the elevator has been broken for four months, you might not know which HOA member is responsible for fixing it.You can always sue all members of the board. During the lawsuit, each named defendant can argue that they are not responsible and get dismissed from the lawsuit if the judge agrees.\n","Document the violation.\n","In order to make a strong court case, you will need evidence of the violation. You can document the violation in several ways:Take pictures of the property. If the common areas or lawn is not being properly maintained, then you should get evidence. Take photographs or video of any area that is not properly maintained.If you videotape something, make sure that the date appears accurately on the video. Also make sure the date appears accurately on your color photographs.You dont have to rely only on photographs and video. You can also sit down and write out a description of when you first discovered the problem. For example, if the elevator is broken, then keep a running track of the dates that it is down.\n","Get supporting records.\n","If you slipped and fell in a common area or were otherwise injured, then you should get evidence of your injuries. You can be compensated for any harm suffered as a result of the HOAs actions. You should gather the following:Medical records. These are helpful at proving the extent of any physical injury. Contact your hospital or doctor and request a copy.[7]Medical bills. These show how much you spent to treat the injury caused by the HOA. You can be compensated for all medical bills and rehabilitation bills.Pay stubs. If you missed work because of the injury, you can be compensated for lost wages. You will need proof of how much money you make. Get a copy of your recent pay stubs or your W-2 form.[8]\n","Schedule a meeting with the board.\n","Before suing, you should probably schedule a meeting with the HOA board. The purpose of the meeting is to find out why the HOA is not fulfilling its duties. You should take your HOA documents and your photographs to the meeting.Be civil.[9] You are still at the information gathering stage right now. There might be a valid reason why the HOA hasnt fixed a problem.For example, the board members might not be aware of the problem. If so, they could be willing to correct it immediately.After the meeting, you should summarize the conversation in a letter, which you can mail to the HOA. The purpose of the letter is to document the substance of your conversation. It is better to write a letter than to secretly record or videotape the conversation, which is illegal in several states.You dont have to wait forever for the board to fix a problem. If more than a week or two passes without the problem being fixed, then you should consider a lawsuit.\n","Get a complaint form.\n","When you decide to sue, you start the lawsuit by filing a complaint in court. The complaint identifies the parties and explains the dispute. You also tell the judge what you want.[10]Many courts now have printed fill in the blank complaint forms for you to use. Ask the court clerk if one is available.If no form is available, then you will need to draft your own complaint. You can find sample complaints on the Internet. You could also buy a book or compact disk which contains legal forms for you to use.

Typically, there are two remedies, which you can ask the judge for:[11]An injunction. This is a legal command to do something or to not do something.[12] You can get an injunction against the HOA to repair dangerous common areas or to maintain the property.Damages. This is money that you get as compensation for your injury. You should seek money damages when you have been physically or financially harmed by the HOAs action or inaction.\n","Complete the complaint form.\n","You should print neatly, using black ink. You could also use a typewriter. Each form is different, but generally you must provide the following information:your name and addressthe HOAs name and addresswhat happened that gave rise to the lawsuitthe legal basis for your lawsuit (the CC&Rs or the HOAs negligence)what you want the judge to do (give you an injunction, award you damages, or both)\n","File the complaint.\n","Make several copies of the completed complaint and take them to the court clerks office. Tell the clerk you would like to file the original. He or she should stamp your copies with the date.\n","Serve a copy on the HOA board.\n","You will need to send the HOA a copy of your complaint. You will also need to serve a summons, which you can get from the court clerk.[13] Ask the clerk what are acceptable methods of service. Generally, you will be able to make service in the following manner:Have someone 18 or older hand-deliver the complaint and summons. This person should not be someone who is part of the lawsuit.Hire a process server to make hand delivery. You can find a process server in your phone book or on the Internet. Process servers will make service for a small fee, usually $45-75.Pay the sheriff to serve copies. In some counties, the sheriff will make service for a small fee. Sheriffs generally charge about the same amount as process servers.Mail it. In some situations, you can mail the complaint and summons using certified mail, return receipt requested. You should ask the court clerk if mailing the documents is allowed.\n","File your proof of service.\n","Whoever makes service will probably need to fill out a proof of service or affidavit of service. [14] They will then either return it to you or send it to the court. If it is returned to you, then you must file it with the court.Keep a copy for your records.\n","Participate in discovery.\n","As soon as the other party responds to your lawsuit, a period of discovery will begin. During discovery, you and the other party will be able to collect and exchange information about the case. Discovery often takes a lot of time and can be very expensive. During discovery you will want to gather facts, get witness statements, find out what the other party plans on saying, see how good the other party's case is, and see how good your own case is. During discovery you will be able to gather information using the following methods:Informal discovery. This will include conducting interviews, gathering public documents, and taking pictures.Depositions. These are formal in-person interviews with someone directly involved in the case. Depositions are taken under oath and will often be videotaped and/or transcribed.Requests for documents. You will be able to request almost any set of documents you believe are relevant to the case. They might include receipts, private emails, text messages, or other documents not readily available to the public.Subpoenas. You can ask the court to require the other party, or third-party, to answer questions or provide documents.[15]\n","Defend against a motion for summary judgment.\n","After discovery but before trial, opposing counsel may want to file a motion for summary judgment trying to dispose of the case before it goes any further. When this happens, they are required to show the judge that there are no disputed issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In addition to filing the motion, their attorney will also have to file affidavits and other supporting evidence tending to prove the assertions being made.The judge will only grant their motion if they can prove that all of the facts of the case, and the law, are on their side.To oppose the motion, you will file affidavits and evidence showing there are disputed issues of fact and law. The court will make every assumption your favor when they make these determinations. So long as you can show a genuine dispute, you will overcome the motion for summary judgment.[16]\n","Attempt to settle.\n","Before expending a large amount of money and time preparing and going to trial, you should attempt to settle with your HOA. The stronger your case is, the more likely it is that the HOA will meet your settlement demands. During settlement negotiations, you should ask for an amount of money that will satisfy your dispute. However, you need to be prepared to provide evidence and facts that show why you are asking for what you are.For example, if you have fallen in a common area that is required to be maintained by the HOA, you might ask that the HOA pay for your medical bills as well as missed pay. Be prepared to submit your bills as well as past pay stubs that can provide the HOA with proof of your claims.\n","Prepare for trial.\n","Each one of your pre-trial moves should be made with a trial in mind. While most cases never get to trial, if yours does, you will need to use everything you have gathered and created up to this point. For example, when you file your complaint, you need to assert certain defenses or else they may be barred when you get to trial. In addition, the evidence you ask for during discovery should all play an integral role in what you need to prove at trial.In other words, trial preparation starts as soon as you hire your attorney.\n","Make an opening statement.\n","The trial will begin with each side making an opening statement. Because you are bringing the lawsuit, you will go first. If you have a lawyer, then he or she will handle the opening statement, along with the rest of the trial.You should keep your opening statement brief. Simply tell the judge what evidence you will introduce.The opening statement is your road map: you tell the judge what evidence you will present and in what order.A good strategy in opening statements is to defuse any bad facts in your opening statement. For example, you might have slipped and fallen in the common area. However, you also might have ignored a sign that said Caution. Floor is wet. You should admit that the sign was up in your opening statement. This helps take the sting out of the bad fact.\n","Present your evidence.\n","You also will present your evidence first. Your evidence will probably consist of documents (like the CC&Rs) as well as witness testimony. If you need witnesses to testify on your behalf, then you should notify them ahead of time and let them know when the trial is being held.Be sure not to ask your witnesses leading questions. A leading question is any question that contains or suggests its own answer. Leading questions can usually be answered yes or no.Instead, ask open-ended questions. For example, if you have a neighbor testifying, you can ask the following:Where do you live?How long have you lived there?Has the lawn always been kept neat?When did the lawn stop getting mowed?\n","Testify on your behalf.\n","You might also testify at trial. If you are suing because of personal injuries suffered, then you most certainly will testify as to what happened and how much pain you are in. Your attorney will ask you questions. If you dont have a lawyer, then you will probably deliver the testimony in the form of a speech. The HOAs lawyer will then be able to cross-examine you.To be an effective witness, remember the following tips:Understand a question before answering it. If you dont know the answer, then say, I dont know. Also ask for clarifications for questions you dont understand.Sit up straight. Look at the lawyer who is asking you a question.Always tell the truth and dont stall.Always answer in words. Dont gesture or make sounds like uh huh. The court reporter can only take down actual words.\n","Deliver your closing argument.\n","After all evidence has been presented, each side gets to make a closing argument. You will go first. You want to put the evidence in the most favorable light to your case.[17]Also try to explain away bad evidence. For example, the HOA might have put up a Caution. Floor is wet. sign. You can argue that witnesses testified that the sign was not visible from the doorway because it was obscured by a potted plant. Therefore, you can argue that the HOA was still responsible for your fall.\n","Wait for the judges decision.\n","After you have given closing arguments, the judge should deliver a ruling. Judgment will be entered and become final at a later date.You should receive a copy of the final judgment in the mail. If you dont, then visit the court clerk and ask how to get a copy.\n","Enforce the injunction.\n","You might have won an injunction against the HOA to fix up the common area. If the common area remains in disarray, even after the judge has ordered the HOA to fix it, then you need to have the injunction enforced. You can do so by filing a Motion for Contempt.Return to the court clerks office and get a form for filing a contempt motion.If the HOA has refused to make necessary repairs, you also might want to hire an attorney.\n","11 Ways to Tell Your Boyfriend You Need More Attention (Without Sounding Needy)\n","The goal is to better your relationship instead of arguing.\n","Its perfectly fine to feel a bit frustrated when youre not getting the attention you want, but try to talk about it calmly.[1] Note that youre not trying to start an argument or be right about the issue, but instead mention that you want to have a respectful discussion to improve your communication and be stronger as a couple.[2]For example, you might say, I care more about feeling good in our relationship more than winning an argument, or I just want to talk about how Ive felt lately without getting into a disagreement.If you already feel the tensions rising, try saying something like, I need a minute to cool down, but Id like to talk about how Im feeling in a little while.\n","Clearly stating whats bothering you helps prevent miscommunication.\n","Your boyfriend cant read your mind, so the only way hell know theres an issue is if you bring it up.[3] Let him know exactly how youre feeling as soon as you feel it so you can address it right away.[4]For example, you might say, I feel like I havent gotten as much attention as I need, or I feel that Ive put more effort into our relationship lately.If you feel like youre not getting as much affection, you might say something like, I wish we could have a little more intimacy, or, I miss when we would message cute things to each other all day.Stay away from using words like always or never when youre talking about the issue since it can make you sound harsher. For example, instead of saying, You always see your friends instead of me, you could say, Ive noticed you seeing your friends more than me lately.\n","Focus on how youre feeling rather than blaming your BF.\n","Criticizing your boyfriend for not paying attention to you might make him get more defensive. Instead, talk about how his actions affect you. You can still use the word you when you reference what he did, but always be sure to mention how you felt because of it so it doesnt sound as accusatory.[5]For example, avoid saying something like, You dont listen to me when Im talking. Instead, say, I dont feel like Im being heard when I talk about things that are important to me.As another example, instead of saying, You never cuddle with me anymore, you could say, Im sad that we arent as physically close as we used to be.If youre not texting as often as you used to, you might try saying, I wish we could text back and forth like when we first started dating.\n","Follow the format, When you do X in situation Y, I feel Z.\n"," When you phrase your sentences like this, it gives your boyfriend the details of what caused the issue and what he can do to make it better.[6] Try to be as specific with your statements as you can when youre explaining to him so there arent any miscommunications.[7]For example, you could say something like, When you come home and take a few minutes before saying hi to me, I feel like Im a second thought.As another example, you might say, When you go out with your friends without asking if I want to come with you, I feel like Im not as important as them.If he isnt texting you back, you could say, When I send you a message and it takes a few hours to respond, I feel like Im being ignored.While this may seem like youre blaming him at first, youre just talking about how his actions made you feel.\n","Work on gradual changes so your boyfriend isnt overwhelmed.\n","Even if there are a lot of things your guy can do to improve, pick one thing thats the most important to address right away. You can always bring up any other changes you want later once he follows through with your first request.[8]For example, you might say something like, I think Ill feel better if you ask me to hang out on the weekend before making plans with your friends.As another example, you might try, Id love it if you could take over planning a few more of our dates so we can balance it out.If you want to be more physically intimate, you could say, I really want to make some time where we can cuddle and be affectionate every day.Some people have a harder time adjusting to changes than others, so be patient with your boyfriend. As long as you see him putting in the effort, hes doing the best he can.\n","Your boyfriend might not give you attention if he feels unfulfilled.\n","While youre chatting, find out if theres anything that your BF feels is missing from the relationship. Give him a chance to open up and explain what would make him the happiest with you.[9] Actively listen to what hes saying so you can see any areas where you can improve too.[10]For example, you might say, Now that Ive told you what I need, is there something more you need from me?As another example, you could say something like, How can I help you feel better in our relationship too?\n","Work together to figure out what will work best to grow your connection.\n","Its pretty rare that youre going to get exactly what you ask for, so talk over the options with your BF. Try to find something that makes both of you feel happy and satisfied. Check in with each other regularly so you can stay updated on whats working and what isnt.[11]For example, you might compromise that your boyfriend can have a night or two each week to spend with friends without asking you.As another example, if you want more physical affection, you might decide to schedule times every day where you can be close and cuddly without any other distractions.\n","Changing how you communicate might impact him more.\n","If you arent able to resolve the topic when youre talking in person, write down what you need from your BF. Tell him whats bothering you just like you would say it in person, and add a suggestion of what he can do to help you feel better. Leave the note for him to read and address on his own time.[12]Your boyfriend may try talking to you in person again or write another letter back.\n","Thanking your BF lets him know that you appreciate his attention.\n","Take a second to recognize all of the things that your boyfriend already does for you that may go unnoticed. The next time he puts effort towards giving you attention or affection, let him know how much you appreciate it.[13] Since hell love to see that youre happy, he may continue doing those things for you.[14]For example, you might say something like, I really appreciate you spending time with me tonight, or Thanks so much for getting these flowers for me. It means the world to me!You could also say something like, It meant a lot when you asked to spend time with me tonight, or Thank you for checking up on me even though youre with your friends.\n","Lead by example for what you want and expect from him.\n","You may make a point to say hi to him as soon as he gets home, talk about how his day was, or cuddle up close to him when youre feeling affectionate. When he sees that youre putting in the extra effort, he may get the hint that you want him to reciprocate.[15]For example, if you notice that your boyfriend has had a rough day, you could give him a massage and ask him what you can do to help him relax.If he still doesnt recognize that you want him to do the same thing for you, then you\n","Find some one-on-one time so he can focus more on you.\n","Ask your guy when he has some free time in his schedule so you can make plans together.

Buy a pair of shoes from one of these brands to make sure that you are getting a high quality product. Most of these companies have built their reputations on years of good customer service as well, so these shoes are likely to be covered by a generous warranty.[1]Find quality footwear brands by reading online reviews.\n","Examine the soles of the shoes to see if they are sturdy.\n","The soles of good shoes should be sturdy enough to protect your feet from sharp objects. They should also provide some kind of cushioning for your feet while you are walking. Examine the bottom of shoes before trying them on so see how thick and strong the soles look.[2]Avoid flat shoes with very thin bottoms, which are likely to break or wear away quickly.\n","Verify that the insole and arch offer adequate foot support.\n","Avoid buying shoes with flat insoles, which will not hold your foot in place properly. Shop for shoes with insoles and arches that are slightly raised and curved to support your foot. Note that some shoes will have removable insoles that can be removed and washed periodically.\n","Look closely at the seams and edges of the shoes.\n","Poor craftsmanship is most evident in the small details on a pair of shoes. Pick up a shoe and look closely at the edges for any loose material or or visible glue. Check the seams for uneven stitching or looped threads. [3]\n","Make sure that the heel is securely attached to the shoe.\n","If you are looking for shoes with pronounced heels, check them carefully to make sure they are well-constructed. If the heels are sewn on, make sure that the stitches are even and secure. If the heels are glued on, check for any gaps where the soles could start peeling off.[4]\n","Go shopping for shoes in the afternoon.\n","You feet expand naturally as you walk on the during the day, and are usually at their most swollen point in the afternoon.[5] If possible, shop for shoes during this period to ensure that you get the best fit. This way you will be sure to buy shoes that accommodate your feet at their biggest, preventing tightness and discomfort later.[6]\n","Wear the same type of socks that you'll be wearing with the shoes.\n","To get an accurate idea of how shoes fit, wear socks with the same thickness as those you intend to wear with your new shoes when you go shopping. Trying on shoes with the wrong socks will likely leave you with shoes that are too tight or loose. This will also give you a better picture of how the shoes will actually look when you wear them.[7]If you are buying sandals or other shoes you won't wear socks with, try them on your bare feet or bring a pair of nylon knee-highs to wear.\n","Ask the salesperson to measure your feet.\n","Knowing the exact size of your feet can make shopping for shoes much simpler. Ask a salesperson at the shoe store if they can measure your feet using a foot sizer. These measurements will give you unique information, which may prompt you to shop for special styles or brands of shoe.[8]For instance, if your feet are wider than average you might want to shop for extra-wide shoes.\n","Leave 0.5 inches (1.3cm) between your big toe and the tip of the shoe.\n","Your feet shift in your shoes when you are standing or walking, so your shoes should be slightly roomy.[9] As a general rule, 0.5 inches (1.3cm) is the ideal amount of space to have between your foot and the shoe material. Test this by sliding your index finger behind your heel to make sure it fits.[10]If your finger doesn't fit, try on the shoe in the next size up.This is a more accurate way of testing your shoe fit than simply pressing down on the toes of your shoes when you try them on.\n","Make sure that you are comfortable standing and walking in the shoes.\n","Good shoes should not have to be broken in to feel comfortable on your feet. When you try on shoes, stand up in them and take a few steps around the store to see how they feel. If you experience pain, tightness, or difficulty walking, opt for a different size or style.[11]Look for a block heel if you want comfortable pumps. A classic black pump is a timeless wardrobe staple. When you want to wear heels but you're looking for something comfortable, choose a shoe with a blocky heel. You'll have more comfort and stability, but you'll still get the look of a pump.[12]\n","Review the comments left by buyers.\n","When you are looking at a particular pair of shoes online, scroll down to look for comments and reviews of the product. Customers who have already bought these shoes may provide important information about how the shoes fit. Avoid buying shoes that have received numerous poor reviews.[13]\n","Make sure that return shipping is free.\n","Shopping for shoes is always a bit of a gamble, so flexible return policies are key.[14] Only buy shoes from websites that offer free return shipping on products that don't fit. Many companies will provide you with a prepaid shipping label for stress-free returns.[15]\n","Compare prices on different websites to get the best deals.\n","You can find good quality shoes at steep discounts online, particularly because of the competition between websites. Once you find a model of shoe that you like, research it online and compare the prices of several reliable sellers. If shoes are out of season or discontinued, you may find them at a fraction of their original retail price.Make sure to factor shipping fees and taxes into shoes prices when comparison shopping.\n","Shop on websites that feature large, multi-perspective pictures.\n","When online shopping for shoes, you will have to rely heavily on images to gauge the product. Shop on websites with clear pictures that are big enough to show details such as stitching and texture.[16] It is also helpful if the websites show each pair of shoes from multiple perspectives.[17]For instance, a good website may show pictures of their shoes from the outer edge, inner arch, and overhead to show the insoles.\n","How to Find Hidden Cameras: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Know where to look.\n","Unfortunately, hidden cameras can be as small as the end of a pen, making it easy to hide them virtually anywhere. When searching a room for hidden cameras, look in places such as the following:[1]Smoke detectorsElectrical outletsPower stripsNight lightsBooks, DVD cases, or video game casesShelvesLaptopsDesktopsComputer miceSmall holes in the wallPictures or other decorationsStuffed animalsLava lampsClocks, watches, USB, or clothes hooks\n","Understand what part of the camera to look for.\n","Most of the camera will usually be hidden, but the camera's lens must always be visible for the camera to be effective. This means that you can always spot a camera by looking for its lens.Any camera installed by an expert will not display wires or lights, but the lens must be visible.\n","Consider the best angle for coverage in a room.\n","It's easiest to search for the camera from the perspective of someone wanting to record the center of activity in a room; for example, if you're worried someone is recording your kitchen, it doesn't make much sense to look for the camera in the floorboards.Corners of rooms often provide the best picture of the whole room, though cameras placed in the corner are often less inconspicuous than most hidden cameras.\n","Look for oddly placed mirrors or decorations.\n","While things like stuffed animals and books can be placed pretty much anywhere, mirrors and decorations (e.g., pictures or paintings) often aren't. If you see a mirror or decoration at a weird height or in an otherwise odd location, there may be a hidden camera embedded.[2]You can check to see if a mirror is a two-way to confirm whether or not a camera is embedded. If the mirror is a two-way, it's suspicious at the very least.\n","Check stuffed animals and clocks.\n","The eyes of stuffed animals and the screws or details on clocks can often conceal a camera.Since stuffed animals and clocks are both easy to move, consider removing them from your vicinity if you suspect that they are hiding cameras.\n","Turn off the lights to search for camera indicators.\n","Most cameras have red or green lights which blink or display steadily; if the hidden cameras were poorly installed, you may be able to see these lights when you turn off the room's lights.[3]It is unlikely that anyone who installed hidden cameras would be too sloppy to hide the camera's indicator lights, so don't rule out hidden cameras if you don't see any.\n","Create a DIY camera detector.\n","Professional camera detectors can cost several hundred dollars, but you can make a cheap one with nothing but a paper towel and a flash light:[4]Turn off all the lights in the room, and draw the blinds (or wait until nightfall).Hold up a paper towel roll to one eye, then close the other eye.Place a flashlight at eye level (in front of the closed eye) and turn on the flashlight.Scan the room, keeping an eye out for glints as you do so.\n","Use your cell phone to scan for interference.\n","This isn't a perfect system, but it will help you find certain types of cameras:[5]Make a call on your cell phone, and leave the caller on the line.Walk around the room with your phone on speakerphone.Listen for crackling, clicking, or buzzing from your phone.\n","Purchase and use an RF detector.\n","An RF detector allows you to scan for hidden cameras by physically sweeping the detector around a room and listening for feedback; if you hear sudden crackling or beeping through the detector, there's a good chance you'll find a hidden camera in front of it.[6]When using an RF detector, you'll need to unplug any items which broadcast radio signals. These include things like kitchen appliances, baby monitors, routers and modems, gaming consoles, TVs, and so on.You may need to cycle through several different frequencies before you find the correct one.RF detectors can be found anywhere from electronics stores to Amazon, and you can expect to spend between $15 and $300 on one.You can also use an RF detector to scan for wireless microphones.[7]\n","Search for public cameras.\n","While public cameras tend to be less nefarious and more conspicuous than their personal counterparts, it may be good to know where the nearest \"hidden\" camera is if you're attempting to dispute a traffic incident or something similar. You can usually find cameras in the following locations:ATMsStore ceilingsTwo-way mirrors in stores and high-profile shops (e.g., jewelry fronts)Gas stationsTraffic lights\n","Open your smartphone's Camera app.\n","On an iPhone, you'll usually find this app on the Home Screen, while Android users can search for the Camera app in the App Drawer.[8]\n","Switch to the front-facing camera.\n","If the camera isn't showing your face while you hold the screen side facing you, tap the \"Rotate\" icon (which usually resembles a circular arrow or two) to flip it.You probably won't be able to perform this process with the rear camera. Most rear cameras have infrared filters, which will prevent the camera from detecting infrared light. The camera must be able to detect infrared light for this method to work.\n","Verify that your smartphone can see infrared light.\n","In order to search for hidden cameras, your smartphone's front camera cannot have an infrared filter. You can determine whether the camera has an IR filter by using a TV remote:[9]Point a remote control at the camera.Press any button on the remote control.Look for a flash on the remote control's front light.\n","Turn off the lights in the room you want to scan.\n","In order to scan for infrared light, you'll need to have the room as dark as possible.If there are any other lights in room (e.g., night lights, power strip indicators, etc.), unplug their sources if possible.\n","Use your smartphone's camera to look for flashing lights.\n","With your phone's screen facing you, rotate while looking for flashing spots. If you see a flashing area, it's most likely a hidden camera's IR light.[10]\n","3 Ways to Watch Football (Soccer) - wikiHow\n","Understand the basic structure of the game.\n","Soccer is a relatively simple game, rules wise. The objective is to score more goals than the other team by putting the ball in their net. Each team has 11 players working together to move the ball and defend against attacks, but they cannot use their arms or hands to do so. The key rules to know include:Each team has one goalie, who is allowed to use his/her hands to defend their goal, but only in the boxes around their goal.A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the entire goal line and is within the frame of the goal.While light contact is accepted, a team of 3 referees is on the field to enforce the rules and make sure the players are attempting to attack the ball, not the other team.\n","Know that the clock counts up to 90 minutes, not down to zero.\n","One of the first things that confuses new soccer watchers is the clock. Unlike most other sports, the clock doesn't count down to zero, it counts up to 90:00. The game is broken into two even 45-minute halves with a 10-15 minute break in the middle. The clock also never stops, and the game only ends with the referee blows the final whistle (usually 2-3 times in a row).This is so the game doesn't stop unexpectedly. Soccer is all about flow, and if the clock was being constantly stopped, started, and checked like in football/basketball then the game would take forever.The game doesn't stop right at the 45' or 90' mark. Rather, the referee adds \"stoppage time\" to account for when the ball was out of bounds, a goal was scored, subs were made, etc. This means the actual game might stop at the 93-minute mark. Most TV broadcasts will show you how many extra minutes are being added in the corner of the screen as halftime or the end approaches.\n","Know the parts of the soccer field.\n","A soccer pitch is a simple rectangle. There are a few extra marks, but the essential ones are all intuitive and easy to read.The Center Circle is where play begins. The ball is placed in the center middle of the field and the starting team gets to pass it. The other team cannot enter the circle until the ball has been touched.The Goal Box Also known as the penalty box or the 18-yard box, this is the rectangle on either end of the field in front of the goals. The goalie can only use their hands in this area.The Touch Lines are the long sides of the field. If the ball crosses over this line completely than the last team to touch the ball gives it to the other team for a throw-in.The Goal Lines The two end lines of the field. If the ball crosses this line and is within the fame of the goal, it is a goal. If it crosses the line, but not in the goal, then it is a goal kick or corner kick, depending on who touched the ball last.\n","Learn how to judge what is and is not a foul.\n","A foul is when a player makes illegal contact with another player on the other team by hitting, tripping, or kicking them. However, there is a lot of physical contact that is never called. Figuring out what is a foul and what isn't is one of the most difficult exercises in soccer, because there are few clear cut \"infractions\" to call like in football or basketball. The best way to remember a foul is to ask yourself -- did the player \"play the ball,\" meaning did they make contact with the ball, or did they \"play the player,\" by pushing/hitting/tripping the other player to win possession? FIFA defines the type of fouls as:Kicking, or attempting to kick, the other player.Tripping, or attemptingJumping/charging at someoneStriking, or attemptingPunching, or attemptingTacklingSpittingHolding.Handling the ball.\n","Understand the offside rule.\n","This rule gives a lot of people consternation, but it is actually pretty straightforward. It simply states that a player cannot receive the ball from a teammate if they are behind the last defender. It is easiest to see with an example--USA Attacker Alex Morgan runs past the defender, leaving just her and the goalie between herself and the goal.Alex's teammate Megan Rapinoe who is in front of the defender Alex just ran by, passes Alex the ball. Alex is offside, and the referee blows the whistle to stop the game.This rule is only complicated because of the speed of play, and several important tweaks to the rule. Still, they are straightforward:If Alex does not touch or play the ball,' but is still in an offside position, she is not offside.If Megan passes the ball, and Alex runs into an offside position to get it, she is not offside.' What matters is where she is when the ball is passed, not where she gets it.If Alex and Megan are on their defensive half of the field, then they cannot ever be offside.You can be offside on a shot or missed pass, too, if you get the ball before anyone else touches it. You cannot be offside if the other team passes or shoots the ball.\n","Know that most infractions are restarted with a free kick.\n","If there is a foul or someone is offside, then play is restarted by a free kick awarded to the opposite team. No person on the other team can be within 10 yards of the ball before it is kicked, at which point normal play resumes.If the ball goes out over the sides of the field it is restarted by a throw-in, which must be done with both hands, over the head.If an attacker misses the goal and it crosses the end line, the goalie gets a free kick from their goal. If a defender kicks the ball out over their own end line the offensive team gets a free kick from the corner of the field.\n","Understand the yellow and red cards are given for serious fouls/infractions.\n","A yellow card is basically a warning, telling the player that their foul was careless, reckless, or excessive. A red card is far more serious, as it means the player is immediately ejected from the game and their team is forced to play with one less player for the rest of the game.Two yellow cards in the same game, for the same player, always leads to an automatic red card.Some infractions, like violent play, intentionally fouling or using your hand to stop and obvious goal, and swearing or threatening the referee, are automatic red cards.\n","Revel in the flow of the game, not the goals.\n","Soccer is not high-scoring, but that doesn't mean it isn't exciting. Soccer is about flow, the give and take between teams as they try to figure each other out and attack weak spots while simultaneously defending their own. Soccer is much more about tension and rapid, sudden changes of pace and momentum then constant scoring. Goals are incredibly difficult to score, making each one a huge, special moment many minutes in the making.Consider goals the culmination of a long attack -- like a battle being fought and contested in the trenches before one side makes big, successful push.The more you understand about soccer, the more enjoyable it becomes beyond just flashy goals. Soccer is too organic, creative, and fluid to be broken down into individual plays.\n","Pay attention to the individual match-ups on the field.\n","A soccer game consists of hundreds of small challenges and individual battles. It could be a wing player attempting to slice and dice a defender or a striker jockeying to win a header in the box. These individual battles, more often than not, determine the entire game. An attacker, for example, could be barely getting by his defender before getting tackled. But if you notice him/her getting more and more shots off as the game continues, you can tell he's beginning to get the upper hand. All it takes is one goal for the battle, and the game, to be decided.\n","Understand the roles and freedoms of each position.\n","How do the individual players move, attack, and defend to aid their team. What are they doing when they don't have the ball? This is where games are won and lost, because all 11 players need to be working together no matter where the ball is.Defenders. Do they give the other team space, or follow them everywhere? Do they stay close to home, or do they roam up on attack? A fast and attacking defender like Philip Lahm or DeAndre Yedlin is often the most exciting player on the field, winning a tackle and then taking the ball right back up the field on an attack. Weaker teams or defenders give the offense lots of time and space, waiting for a 2nd defender to join them instead of attacking on their own.Midfielders. What do the players in the middle of the field do? This is where the tempo of the game is dictated, and they are the most important tactical players on the field. Are they going out wide or backward a lot? If so, they're likely probing for holes in the defense, sitting back and waiting for chances. Midfielders that dribble, attack, and pass forward a lot are trying to push the team forward for a goal, exposing their defenses by pressuring the other team to respond quickly to their attacks.Attacker/Striker. Are they checking backward often, getting the ball and passing it quickly? Are they holding far up the field, using size and speed to get the ball, turn and shoot? Are they running onto passes often then putting moves and tricks on defenders to win space? An attacker is there to create havoc for the defenders, even when they don't have the ball, and these match-ups are often the most crucial.\n","Note how teams create and erase space.\n","Managing the field on the fly is the secret weapon of a good soccer team. Passing is not always used directly to attack the goal. Rather, it is used to force the other team to move, shift, and adapt, potentially making a mistake and leaving a hole open. The basic tenet of soccer tactics is manipulating the other team to give you space in front of the goal for a shot when you're attacking, or closing down space so that they other team can't move forward when playing defense.Notice how many balls are played to players on the run. This is because they are running into open space. They need to get the ball before a defender joins them and closes down the opening.Is a team \"bunkering in\" by placing all of their defenders near their goal? This is used to prevent goals, especially if they have a lead. It can, however, lead to lots of free shots from farther out which will crack the facade of a defending team.Watch the defense of a great team, like Italy, to see how a team masterfully controls space. You'll notice that they move as one consistent line, eliminating pockets of space in front of and behind them as a unit.\n","Check the team's formations.\n","Much like defensive patterns in football, soccer teams have general patterns for their players that greatly impact their style of play. Formations are always written from the back upwards, excluding the goalkeeper. So a 4-4-2 would mean there are 4 defenders, 4 midfielders, and 2 attackers/strikers.The \"classic\" formation, a 4-4-2 is a solid, well-rounded strategy that has been used for decades. That said, it lacks in creativity and is often used for defensive or  counterattack-oriented teams.A team's formation says a lot about their strategy going forward. Do they have 1 striker and a big midfield? If so, they're likely looking to control the center of the field and run players up into space on the wings. Are they sitting back with 5 defenders? Where players are placed tells you how the team wants to attack and defend.\n","Note a team's style.\n","Your appreciation of soccer will shoot up incredibly once you notice not only what teams or players are doing, but why. How do the tactics, match-ups, and pace of play come together in a good team? How are they attacking (along the sides of the field a lot, through the middle, by hitting big huge crosses up the field?) and how successful are they? Do all of their passes go through one player, or is everyone on the field touching the ball?It can help to watch how the best teams in the world play a cohesive, recognizable game. Brazil is known for flash, talent, and speed. Italy is known for slower play and stalwart defense. The USA is a quick, counterattacking team that tries to make the most of its limited chances against better teams with lightening-fast attacks.If you watch a lot of American sports, think about each attack like a play in football. Whereas a one football team might focus on the passing game to be effective and another the running, a soccer team might rely on the wings (sides) to attack defenders and put crosses into the box or a few big players to muscle out and attack up the middle. The only difference is that soccer plays are fluid and organic, not chosen ever 15 seconds, so strategies are constantly evolving.\n","Revel in the theater and drama of a great game.\n","They are beautiful contests marked by near misses, technical brilliance, passionate players, and non-stop, commercial free push and pull. Tactics and substitutions are dissected with chess-like precision, good teams fail to find the goal when they should have 5 goals already, and underdogs can sneak a goal in even after 85 minutes of constant pressure. Soccer is about 2-3 large climaxes in the midst of an intense game, not constant scoring, and is best enjoyed as such.[1]\n","Go to a game in person.\n","The best way to catch the soccer bug is to be in the stands. You can feel the collective rise and falls of emotion from your fellow fans, see both team's tactic happening across the entire team, and you'll learn a few colorful chants in the process. Like most sports, soccer is best enjoyed in person, when you can really get swept up into the game.\n","Watch soccer year round by switching between many different leagues and tournaments.\n","Soccer is on year-round, as there are so many different leagues, tournaments, and teams across the world that you can almost always be sure of finding a game. While the availability of certain games depends on where you live and your TV provider, following your favorite teams is getting easier and easier in the online era. Moreover, the widespread nature of soccer means that almost every country and area will have a team to watch.If you want to watch a game, but can't find it on TV, search for the game and date, plus the word \"streaming\" in your internet browser. Many soccer blogs will post all of the different ways to see the game.Check out your local teams, including semi-pro teams. Much like baseball, soccer players and teams can move up and down in the rankings from season to season and even become national stars after several years. The rankings and leagues are fluid, and the enormous global market means players move frequently.\n","Find out which national leagues are currently in season.\n","Just about every country on the planet has a soccer league, and while most of them play through the winter months, many of them are staggered in order to make room for international tournaments later in the year. These teams are colloquially known as \"clubs.\"The English Premier League, generally considered the best league in the world, plays from late August to early May. La Liga (Spain), Seria A (Italy), Bundesliga (Germany), and Ligue 1 (France), the other major European leagues, all run on similar timelines.Major League Soccer, America's league, runs from March to October. Liga MX, the Mexican league, runs in both the summer and winter.\n","Choose a team or league to follow to get invested in the scores.\n","All sports are more fun if you have someone to root for. Pick a team or league based on whatever feels right to you, whether it is your hometown, has your favorite player, or simply seems like a fun team to root for. Even individual leagues have their own intricacies, quirks, and unique facets:The English Premier League is where all the best players go because it has the most money. The play is crisp, tactical, and fast, and there are a lot of teams that can compete in any given game.La Liga, the Spanish League, is fast and flashy. The players are technical and the game is beautiful, and the top clubs, like Real Madrid, are among the best in the world every single year.The Bundesliga, Germany's league, is technical and physical, and produces many of the best players in the world. It is less watched, perhaps, than other leagues in Europe, but contains some of the highest quality play.[2]The MLS is a young, quickly growing league marked by physicality and young, developing players.\n","Watch out for the major club tournaments.\n","Almost every league in the world doesn't actually have a playoff. Instead, points are tallied up from every game, and the highest point total wins the league. However, there are a variety of major tournaments each year for club teams, and this is almost always the highest quality soccer you can watch every year.The Champions League is a tournament between all of the best clubs from every country in Europe. Qualifying takes place over the summer and winter, with the final in May.The FA Cup is a tournament between every pro or semi-pro team in England, no matter what their standing is.Every continent has versions of this cup (such as South America's Copa Libertadores) but the European League is the best-known tournament.\n","Follow your country's national team in major world tournaments.\n","A country's national team is made up of only citizens of that country, and these teams compete in the world's biggest tournaments, like the World Cup. International soccer is played in the summer and consists of a series of games, qualifications, and tournaments that ultimately culminate in the World Cup every 4 years.Friendlies are practice games that mean little, but are essential for team building and testing out players and strategies. Since most players leave to play for their club team during the year, these are crucial practice games for coaches.Qualification for major tournaments, such as the Gold Cup, the World Cup, and the Confederations Cup, take place every single year. These crucial games determine, ultimately, what 32 countries make it to the World Cup.Tournaments These round-robin and knock-out events are what every national team lives for. Winning some of them, like the Gold Cup, gets you an automatic free bid to the World Cup, the ultimate tournament in soccer.[3]\n","Follow soccer blogs, teams, and accounts to be in the know about upcoming games.\n","There is so much soccer on TV at any given time, it is hard not to find something worth watching. But the deluge of information can be overwhelming, especially for new fans. If you don't have a team or can't figure out who to watch, the best place to start is the English Premier League. It runs from August to May, and all of the games are played on Saturday and Sunday, always, making it easy to sit down and get a good game even if you aren't in the know about the schedules.[4]\n","How to Grow Peanuts (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n","Know the benefits of starting a peanut plant indoors.\n","Peanuts have a long growing season and require 100 to 130 frost-free days to reach maturity.If you live in a cooler, Northern region, you should start the plants indoors roughly one month before the last anticipated frost.If you live in a warmer, Southern region, you can either plant the peanuts directly outdoors after the last frost or start them indoors a few weeks prior to the last frost.\n","Pick out good seed peanuts.\n","You can plant raw peanuts purchased at the grocery store, but you might find it easier to grow peanuts if you start with seed peanuts purchased from a gardening store.Note that peanuts used as seeds must remain in their shells until just before planting. Otherwise, they will dry out too quickly and will fail to produce.Never use roasted peanuts. These will not germinate.\n","Fill a clean container with moist potting soil.\n","Use a bowl or starter pot roughly 4 inches (10 cm) deep and fill it about 2/3 full with potting soil.[1]If the soil is not already damp, moisten it with a watering can now, before you add the seed peanuts.The safest container to use would be a paper or peat pot since you can place the entire seedling, pot and all, into the ground when transplanting. You could use a plastic bowl or pot if that is your only alternative, though.Make sure that container is clean before you plant the peanuts, especially if you are using a plastic container. Wash it with warm water and soap, rinse well, and dry with clean paper towels.\n","Place a few seed peanuts on top of the soil and cover.\n","Arrange four peanuts, with their shells removed, equidistant from each other on top of the soil, pressing them gently into the soil. Cover with roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of loose, moist soil.When shelling the peanuts, make sure that you do not remove the brown paper coating surrounding each nut seed. If you remove this or damage it, the peanuts may not germinate.You could plant the peanuts without removing the shell first, but they will grow quicker if you do remove the shell.If the soil is not moist when you add it, lightly water it with a watering can or spray bottle until it is moist to the touch but not soaked.If planting the seeds directly outside, plant them 2 inches (5 cm) deep and 8 inches (20 cm) apart.\n","Choose a sunny location.\n","Peanut plants require full sun in order to grow properly.[2]Sun is important for the sake of photosynthesis, but full sun is advised because areas that receive full sun are likely to be the warmest in your garden. Peanut plants thrive in warm soil.\n","Wait until after the last frost passes.\n","Peanuts are fairly sensitive to frosts, so you should wait at least two to three weeks after the last suspected frost before you transplant any seedlings started indoors an outdoor garden.The same guideline applies if you are planting seed peanuts directly into an outdoor plot. Wait several weeks after the last frost passes. Otherwise, the seed peanuts will not germinate.The temperature of the soil should be about 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 degrees Celsius), at minimum.[3]\n","Improve the soil quality, if necessary.\n","The plant bed should be composed of loose, well-drained soil. If your soil is too heavy, you should add a few handfuls of sand to the soil to improve the quality and make it less dense. Dig and mix the sand in with a small trowel.Avoid clay-type soils, which are hard to improve sufficiently.You could use aged compost, as well, but you should limit the amount you use since it could give off nitrogen. This would be beneficial for many plants, but peanuts produce their own nitrogen, and adding more can be too much and ultimately stunt the growth of the plant.You may also need to balance the soil pH if it is too acidic. Do so by adding a small amount of agricultural lime to the soil and mixing it in thoroughly.[4]\n","Dig deep into the soil.\n","Dig at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) down into the soil, even if the plant is not yet that deep.The roots need plenty of room to spread out. Digging into the soil helps to break up any compact areas, ultimately making it looser, and providing the roots the space they need.After digging into the soil, fill in the bottom of each hole with 2 inches (5 cm) or so of the loose soil. Otherwise, you may accidentally plant the seedling too deep.[5]\n","Plant the seedlings 10 inches (25 cm) apart.\n","The stem and leaf portions should be above the ground, but the root system should be completely below ground.Fill in the rest of the hole gently with loose soil.If using a decomposable planter, place the entire thing in the ground. If not, gently squeeze the sides of you container to loosen its contents. Tip the container so that the plant, roots, and soil come out in a clump in your hands. Transfer the entire clump to the outdoor plot.Avoid exposing the sensitive roots.If you planted the seed peanuts directly outdoors, you may decide to plant 2 to 3 seeds at each spot initially. You will need to thin the plants out, though, leaving only the strongest one at each spot.\n","Water the soil well.\n","Use a gentle hose or watering can to moisten the soil so that it feels moist when you touch the surface.Note, however, that the soil should not be soaking wet. If puddles are forming on the surface of the plot, you may have added too much water.\n","Loosen the soil after a few weeks.\n","[6] Once your plants reach a height of 6 inches (15.24 cm), you should lightly and carefully dig around the base of each plant to loosen the soil.The plant will develop runners as it grows, and each of these runners will develop blossoms. The flowers will wilt and bend down, but you should not pick them off.These downward stems are called \"pegs.\" Your peanuts will grow off of these pegs, and the stems need to find their way underground in order to grow those peanuts.[7]By making the soil looser, you make it easier for the pegs to get underground.\n","Hill the soil around the base of the plant later on.\n","After the pegs have found their way underground and the plants themselves are about 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall, you should gently form the soil into small hills around each buried peg and around the base of the plant.Doing this provides extra warmth and protection for the peanuts growing on the ends of the buried pegs.\n","Lay down a light mulch.\n","Spread out 2 inches (5 cm) of straw or grass clippings over the area immediately after creating the hills.Mulch prevents most weeds from coming up.Additionally, it also keeps the soil warm, moist, and soft.Do not use heavy mulches like wood chips, though. Additional pegs may need to break through the soil, and they will not be able to do so with heavy mulches in the way.\n","Water regularly.\n","Use a watering can or garden hose with a gentle spray setting to provide the plants with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water each week.Ideally, peanuts should be given a little water at a time. They do best when the soil is slightly dry on the surface but moist at about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down. This can be determined by sticking your fingertip into the soil and noting how much of your finger you can insert into the soil before you feel moisture.\n","Avoid fertilizers with high levels of nitrogen.\n","Fertilizers are not usually necessary to begin with when growing peanuts, but if you do opt to use a fertilizer, make sure that it does not contain large amounts of nitrogen.Peanuts supply their own nitrogen. Adding more nitrogen to this will produce very bushy plants with thick foliage and little fruit yield.Once the plants begin to flower, you can begin treating them with a fertilizer rich in calcium. Doing so may help maximize nut formation.\n","Protect your plants with mesh fencing.\n","The biggest threat to your peanut plants are squirrels, chipmunks, and other small critters looking for a free feast. Placing mesh fencing around your plants is a simple, sure way to keep these uninvited dinner guests out of your crop.Push the fencing 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) below the ground to protect the peanuts as they grow underneath. Many mice and squirrels will try to dig the plants up after nuts begin forming, and if the netting does not extend below ground, they may succeed.\n","Use insecticide only as needed.\n","Peanut plants are not usually victims when it comes to pests of the insect variety. Some insects do occasionally make themselves a nuisance, though, including cutworms, cucumber beetles, and aphids. These insects usually attack by eating the plants.[8]Spray the leaves with a pyrethrin-based pesticide for best results.If you want to stick to something organic, sprinkle ground red pepper on the leaves, instead.\n","Dig out the entire plant with a spading fork.\n","You should harvest the peanuts before the first frost of fall occurs, since peanuts at this stage are still sensitive to frost attacks.The plant will turn yellow and begin to wilt when it is ready to be harvested.[9]Gently dig up the entire plant with your gardening fork, lifting it up from beneath the roots. Shake off most of the soil clinging to the roots.A healthy plant will usually yield about 30 to 50 peanuts.\n","Dry the plant out.\n","Hang the plant indoors in a dry location for about a month.For the first one to two weeks, let the peanuts cure on the plant as they are in a warm, dry spot.For the remaining two weeks or so, pull the nuts off and let them dry in the same warm, dry spot.\n","Roast or store the plants as desired.\n","You can enjoy the peanuts raw or roasted, or you can save them for later.To roast peanuts, bake them in an oven set at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes.To store peanuts, leave them in their shells and place them in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to  6 months.If you cannot refrigerate your peanuts, they can stay good for 3 months in a dry, dark storage area.Peanuts can also be frozen for a year or longer.\n","How to Sign in to Zoom on Desktop, Mobile and Web Browser\n","Go to https://zoom.us/signin.\n","You can use any web browser to log in.This method is good to use if you're on a different computer that doesn't have the Zoom desktop client installed, or if you rather use Zoom without installing any software.\n","Enter your Zoom email and password or click to sign in with SSO, Google, or Facebook.\n","If you use SSO, Google, or Facebook you may be prompted to confirm your account and your birthday.SSO stands for single sign-on, which is something you'd be assigned if you're using a company's Zoom account.\n","Click Sign In (if you used your email and password).\n","You'll be signed in and redirected to your dashboard.To sign out, click your profile picture in the upper right corner of the page and select Sign Out from the drop-down menu.[1]\n","Open Zoom.\n","You'll find this in your Start menu or in the Applications folder in Finder.If you don't have the Zoom client downloaded, you can go to https://zoom.us/support/download and the download will automatically begin.

The containers need tops with tiny vents or airholes (wire mesh works, as does poking holes in the lid) that allow for airflow without letting the mealworms escape.  Darkling beetles can't fly, but a lid is a safety precaution that you should have.Getting at least two (three, if you want to start a very large colony) is essential because you'll need to separate the beetles from the larvae a few weeks into the process. If you fail to separate them, they will eat one another.Do not use wooden containers, as mealworms are able to eat through these.\n","Prepare your mealworm substrate.\n","Mealworms feed on grains and cereals, and that's what you'll need to use as substrate. You can buy mealworm substrate from a feeder supply store, or you can make your own mixture from bran flakes, corn flakes, oatmeal and other cereals.  The substrate should be ground to a fine powder to make it easier to pick out the worms and beetles when you need to move them.Depending on the needs of the pet you are feeding, you can add bone meal, cricket chow or other ingredients to change the nutritional profile of the mealworms.\n","Buy mealworms.\n","The number of mealworms you buy for your starter stock depends on how many animals you aim to feed. If you need to use the meal worms to start feeding the animals right away, aim for 5,000 or so to begin with.[1] It takes a few months for the mealworms to reproduce, so this population will get depleted at first.If you don't mind waiting a few months for new mealworms, you can start with as few as 150 mealworms.\n","Set up a stable growing environment.\n","Mealworms reproduce best when they're kept at a steady temperature of 70 to 75F (21 to 24C).[2]  Choose a place in your home where you can keep the temperature consistent. The area should be clean and free of chemicals that could contaminate the colony.A heated garage or basement would be the optimal place to keep your mealworms.You can buy a heater to use near the containers to keep the temperature steady for your mealworms.If you keep the mealworms too chilly, they won't reproduce.Mealworms prefer a little bit of humidity in their environmentjust make sure it isn't too humid, or else fungi might begin to grow. You can get a humidity meter online to help maintain a good balance.\n","Assemble the first bin.\n","Line the first bin with 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6cm) of substrate. Place your starter stock in the bin. Slice up an apple, a carrot, or a potato and place the slices on top of the substrate, to provide moisture for the mealworms. Put the lid on top of the bin. The mealworms will begin eating the substrate and reproducing. The mealworms may pull the food under the substrate to eat it, which is completely normal.\n","Wait for the mealworms to reproduce.\n","The mealworms, which are the larvae of the darkling beetle, will need 10 or more weeks to go through their life cycle and reproduce to make new mealworms. They will change from larvae to pupae, then from pupae to mature beetles. The beetles will copulate and lay eggs in the substrate, which hatch 1 to 4 weeks later.[3]  While you wait for this process to take place, check the bin every day and take care of the mealworms in the following ways:Change out the cut vegetables if they appear to get moldy.Keep the temperature stable at 70 to 75F (21 to 24C).Remove dead mealworms or beetles and discard them.[4]\n","Move the beetles after the eggs hatch.\n","Once the new larvae hatch from their eggs, you'll need to move all the pupae and beetles to the second container. If you keep them all in the same container, the beetles will feed on the larvae. When you move them to the second container, they'll lay eggs and continue the reproduction process. To move the beetles and pupae, do the following:Prepare the second container by lining it with 23 inches (5.17.6cm) of substrate.Pick out the beetles and pupae by hand and place them in the new container. Use gloves if you want to. The beetles won't bite and rarely fly.Put a few slices of carrots or potatoes in the second container, then cover.\n","Feed the mealworms to your pets.\n","Once the new larvae are big enough (before they become pupae) you may feed them to your pets. Remember that any mealworms left in the bin will mature and become pupae, then beetles. Continue moving pupae and beetles to the second container as they mature.You can store mealworms in the refrigerator to make them keep longer if you want to set some aside for feeding your pets.\n","Sift the substrate and keep the process going.\n","Once the life cycle has completed in the first bin, the substrate will be depleted. Pick out all remaining mealworms and place them in a clean bin while you disinfect the first one. After cleaning and drying it thoroughly, add a few inches of new substrate, then replace the worms in the bin to begin the process again.\n"]}]}]}
